\maketitle

\textbf{Validation of gender prediction.} We first validated the
genderize.io algorithm using a set of 3265 names whose gender had been
hand-coded based on appearance (1). The names were supplied to the
genderize algorithm both with and without the accompanying country data.
The genderize algorithm returned gender predictions for 2899 queries
when first names were given and 2167 when country data was also supplied
(732 names were associated with countries unsupported by genderize).

Sensitivity and specificity are measurements of an algorithm's tendency
to return correct answers instead of false positives (e.g., a man
incorrectly gendered as a woman) or false negatives (e.g., a woman
incorrectly gendered as a man). The closer these values are to 1, the
smaller the chance that the algorithm will return the correlating false
response. Accuracy is a composite measure of the algorithm's ability to
differentiate the genders correctly. These measurements were calculated
from the data sets (with and without country data supplied) at three
different probability threshold cutoffs: the default genderize (0.5), a
probability threshold of 0.85 (0.85), and a modified probability of
0.85, which factors in the number of instances returned (pmod0.85)(2,
3).

At the 0.5 threshold, the data set returned a sensitivity of 0.8943 and
specificity of 0.9339 for an accuracy of 0.911, compared to a marginally
higher accuracy of 0.9146 for the data set where country data were
included (Table S1). Generally speaking, the accuracy increases as the
threshold increases, with slight trade offs between sensitivity and
specificity. For the purposes of our analysis, we opted to use the
pmod0.85 threshold moving forward (Table S1, in bold).

To understand the extent of geographic bias in our gender assignment
against regions and languages with gender-less naming conventions or
that lack social media for incorporation into the genderize algorithm,
we compared the number of names predicted without associated country
data to when country data was also supplied. In our test data set, the
top five countries associated with names were the United States,
Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and China. The countries with the
highest proportion of un-predicted genders when country data were
supplied are Cambodia, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, and Mexico, where
the maximum number of names supplied ranged from 1 to 15. To determine
the impact of each country towards the overall percentage of names whose
genders were not predicted (27.14\%), we found the difference between
the percent of names un-predicted for each country and the overall
percentage, multiplied by the proportion of observations from that
country to the total observations and finally divided by the overall
percentage of un-predicted names (Fig. S8A). The top five countries with
the greatest impact on un-predicted names, and thus the countries
receiving the most negative bias from genderize were Canada, China,
Ireland, Belgium, and Sweden. These data suggest that there is likely
some bias against countries with gender-neutral naming conventions
(China), and indicates the stringency with which the algorithm applies
gender to names that are accompanied by country data. For instance,
strongly gendered names such as Peter and Pedro were not assigned gender
when associated with Canada.

We next applied the genderize algorithm at the pmod0.85 threshold to our
journals data set and tested its validity on a small portion. All first
names collected from our data set were submitted to genderize both with
and without country data and only those with a pmod equivalent to or
greater than 0.85 were retained. Next, the predicted genders were
assigned to individuals as described previously (Fig. S7). Given the
relatively small number of editors and senior editors in our data set,
the presenting gender (man/woman) of editors and senior editors in our
data set was hand-validated using Google where possible. Of the 1072
editor names, 938 were predicted by our application of genderize for an
accuracy of 0.9989, thus increasing our confidence in the gender
predictions where made.

In our full data set, the five countries with the most individuals were
the United States, China, Japan, France, and Germany. The countries with
the highest proportion of un-predicted genders were Burundi, Chad,
Kingman Reef, North Korea, and Maldives, where the maximum number of
names supplied ranged from 1 to 4. Proportionally, fewer names in our
full data set were assigned gender than in our validation data set
(40.01\% un-predicted versus 27.14\% un-predicted, respectively). Since
adjusting the workflow to predict the gender of names both with and
without country data, the countries receiving the most negative bias
from genderize were China, Japan, South Korea, India, and Taiwan (Fig.
S8B). These data indicate what we previously predicted, that the
genderize algorithm has bias against countries with gender-neutral
naming conventions.
