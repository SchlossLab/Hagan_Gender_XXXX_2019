#Abstract

#Introduction

  + STEM has a representation problem - cite papers on gender/minority representation in publishing
  
  Evidence has accumulated over the decades that academic research has a representation problem. With regards to gender, while at least 50% of biology Ph.D. graduates are women, the number of women in postdoctoral posiitions and tenure-track positions are less than X and X%, respectively. Studies examining other metrics such as race and ethnicity find that .... Predictabily, the disparities increase along with academic rank. There have been many proposed reasons for 
  
  + Increasing globalization of journals/peer review
  
  + Increasing awareness of diversity metrics & impacts on productivity/innovation
  
  + History and mission of ASM journals
      + Why publish with ASM: "Reinvest in and support your scientific community"; "quality peer review and editorial leadership"
      + ASM mission: "ASM is an inclusive organization, engaging with and responding to the needs of its diverse constituencies."; "Enhance ASM's ability to address all members' needs through development and assessment of programs and services"

  + This study
      + Serve membership - accountability
      + Cumulative data since 2012 to see where ASM stands
      + Use submissions and compare to membership to see where disparity exists (if at all)

#Results

##Validating gender analysis

  + predicted vs percieved gender of editors
  
  + predicted names by country (countries associated w. NA genders?)
  
  + Nicole's dataset?

##Gender
   + gender of all editors over time
   
   + breakdown into editor type: e.g., EiC, senior, associate? (ed_gender_time.R)
   
   + gender of all reviewers over time
   
   + gender of all senior/coresponding authors over time
   
   + gender of all first authors over time
   
   + gender of all authors
   
   + proportion of gender at each stage: e.g., author, reviewer, editor by type
   
   + invited manuscripts by gender
   
   + male/female dominated categories? journals?
   
##Geographic
   
   + geographic origin of all editors over time
   
   + breakdown into editor type: e.g., EiC, senior, associate?
   
   + geographic dist of all reviewers over time
   
   + geographic of all senior/coresponding authors over time
   
   + geographic of all first authors over time
   
   + geographic of all authors
   
   + proportion of geography at each stage: e.g., author, reviewer, editor by type
   
   + invited manuscripts by gender
   
   + submitted manuscripts by gender
   
   + geographically dominated categories? journals?

   
#Discussion
  + Compare to global micro stats (Elsiever Gender report)
  
  + compare proportions to ASM membership: 37% self-reported as F in 2012
  
  + impact of under rep in publication process (Leahey, 2007; )
  
  + describe society health checklist - apply to journals
  
  + future directions
      + lay out forth coming papers to use this data to examine ASM peer review for gender & geographic bias
      + are female-authored papers handled differently from male-authored (number of revisions/decisions)
      + M/F reviewer/editor recommendations differ by gender of author/editor/reviewer
      + publication frequency & authorship prestige of M vs F 

#Data and Methods

###Data

All manuscripts handled by ASM journals (mBio...) that recieved an editorial decision between January 1st, 2012 and August 31st, 2018 were supplied as XML files by ASM's publishing platform, eJP. Data were extracted from the XML documents provided using R statistical software (version 3.4.4) and the `XML` package. Data manipulation was handled using the `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `xml2` packages for R. Variables of interest included: the manuscript number assigned to each submission, manuscript type (e.g., full length research, erratum, editorial), category (e.g., microbial ecology), related (previously submitted) manuscripts, versions submitted, dates (e.g., submission, decision), author data (e.g., first, last, and corresponding authorships, total number of authors), reviewer data (e.g., reviewer score, recommendation, editor decision), and person data (names, institutions, country) of the editors, authors, and reviewers. 

It is common practice at ASM journals for manuscripts whose reviewers recommend extensive experimental revisions be given a decision of "reject with resubmission encouraged". If resubmitted, the authors are asked to note the previous (related) manuscript and the resubmission is assigned a new manuscript number. Multiple related manuscripts were tracked together by generating a unique grouped manuscript number based on the recorded related manuscript numbers. This grouped manuscript number served multiple purposes including: tracking a single manuscript through multiple rejections or transfers between ASM journals and to avoid duplicate counts of the same authors. 

###Gender assignment

The gender assignment API genderize.io was used to predict an indivdual's gender based on their given names, and country where possible. The genderize.io platform uses data gathered from social media to predict gender based on given names with the option to include an associated language or country to enhance the odds of succesful prediction. Since all manuscripts are submitted in English, we matched each individuals country against the list of X country names accepted by genderize.io. Using the `GenderGuesser` package for R, all unique given names associated with an accepted country were submitted to the genderize.io API and any names returned without a predictive assignment of either male or female were resubmitted without an associated country. All predictive assignments of either male or female are returned with a probability match of 0.50 or greater. The predicted genders of all given names (with and without an associated country) whose probabilities were greater or equal to our arbitrary success cut off of 0.65 were used to assign predicted gender to the individuals in our dataset. Predicted genders were assigned to individuals in the following order: first names and country, first names, middle names and country, middle names. Individuals who were not assigned a gender are given values of "N/A" and referred to in the analysis as those with an "unknown" gender. The predicted (male/female) gender of editors and senior editors in our dataset was hand validated using Google.
