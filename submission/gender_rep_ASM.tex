\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Scientific societies play an integral role in the formation and
maintanence of scientific communities. They host conferences that
provide a forum for knowledge exchange and networking, as well as
opportunities for increased visibility as a researcher. Scientific
societies also frequently publish the most reputable journals in their
field, facilitating the peer review process to vet new research
submissions. As such, societies have great power to set both
professional and scientfic norms in their community by choosing what
behaviors are rewarded and what types of research are accepted for
publication. Given that the authorship of such research publications is
a key criterium for hiring and promotion processes in academic circles,
it is a coveted measure of success. Accordingly, editors and reviewers
of research journals have a substantial influence over the futures of
hopeful authors. While the membership of scientific societies is likely
to reflective of all those who participate in the field, regardless of
career track, the gatekeepers for peer review (reviewers and editors)
are more reflective of the academy than the society of a whole.

Evidence has accumulated over the decades that academic research has a
representation problem. With regards to gender, while at least 50\% of
biology Ph.D.~graduates are women, the number of women in postdoctoral
positions and tenure-track positions are less than 40 and 30\%,
respectively @article\{sheltzer\_elite\_2014\}. Studies examining other
metrics such as race and ethnicity find that less than 10\% of all
science and engineering doctorates were awarded to underrepresented
minorities, while less than 25\% of science and engineering doctorates
in early career academia identify as non-white (NSF ADVANCE, 2014).
Predictabily, the disparities increase alongside academic rank, a
phenomenon known as hierarchical segregation
@article\{potvin\_diversity\_2018\}. There have been many proposed
reasons for these disparities (particularly against women) that include
biases in training and hiring, the impact of children on career
trajectories, a lack of support for primary caregivers, and a lack of
recognition, which culminate in reduced productivity as measured by
research publications.

Recently, scientific societies and publishers have begun examining their
own data to evaluate representation of, and bias agains, women and
minorities in their peer review processes. The American Geological Union
found that while the acceptance rate of women-authored publications was
greater than that for publications authored by men, women submitted
fewer manuscripts than men and were used as reviewers only 20\% of the
time (Lerback, 2017). Fox et al., have found that for the journal
\emph{Functional Ecology}, the proportion of women invited to review
depended on the gender of the editor and that editors were more likely
to invite individuals from their own geographic region to review (Fox,
2016). Despite the disproportional representation of lead women authors,
several studies have concluded that there is no significant bias aginst
papers authored by women (C\&W, 2011; Fox, 2016; Handly, 2015; Edwards,
2018). Conversely, a preprint study of the peer review process at eLife
found statistically significant bias against women, particularly from
review groups composed of all men (Murray, 2018). Studies looking at the
geographic distribution of authors have also found poor representation
of non-Western countries and statistically significant bias based on
geography and percieved ``non-english speaking'' authors (Murray, 2018;
Handley, 2015; Edwards, 2018).

However, gender and geographic representation can differ dramatically
according to the scientific field and no studies to-date seem to have
investigated academic publishing in the field of microbiology (Elseiver
report). {[}Stats on ASM size/membership that make it a good study
system{]}. In its mission statement, the American Society for
Microbiology (ASM) notes that it is ``an inclusive organization,
engaging with and responding to the needs of its diverse
constituencies.'' The ASM also pledges to ``address all members' needs
through development and assesment of programs and services'' while the
ASM Journals Department boasts of ``quality peer review and editorial
leadership.'' Therefore, in an effort to be transparent with ASM journal
patrons and ASM members, the purpose of this study is to describe who
are ASM journals. In other words, what is the gender and geographic
representation of authors, reviewers and editors during peer review at
ASM journals? Additionally, does that representation reflect the field
of microbiology and ASM members?

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

This study uses the data from manuscripts submitted to ASM journals that
had a final decision rendered between January 2012 and August 2018.

\emph{Gender in Gatekeepers} + Editor Notes: + The proportions of
men/women editors are similar for both editors and senior editors --
only showed editors + There is a slow trend toward gender parity in
editors + Need to add the N of each editorial group: senior editors,
editors, eic + compare senior editors? only m journals use that
heirarchy

\begin{verbatim}
+ Who carries the editorial burden?
   + How many manuscripts are editors handling -- Women handle a higher median of papers than men, across ASM. Varies by journal
   + Is it proportional to the author representation? -- in some cases, but also difficult to compare b/c of the high "unclear" proportion of authors
   + Does it change by EiC? -- doesn't seem to. Can I add gender of EIC to the graph somehow?
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}

  Reviewer Notes:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Median number of paper reviews are equivalent across genders, though
    men seem slightly more likely to review more papers - trends
    representative of journals, except for MCB where ``unclear''
    reviewers are a greater proportion than women
  \item
    Slight increase in the proportion of women over time (\& decrease of
    men), more women reviewers than ``unclear''
  \item
    trends and approximate proportions are equvalent for potential
    reviewers and actual reviewers
  \item
    greater \# of women (unique indvidiuals) have been suggested as
    potential reviewers than \# of women senior authors -- only 1/2 have
    actually been reviewers
  \item
    similar trend for min, except that the proportions of potential \&
    accepted seem to be higher - calculate \& add proportions relative
    to senior authors
  \item
    different trend for ``unclear'' authors where senior \textgreater{}
    potential \textgreater{} accepted
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Who carries the burden of peer review?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    How often are reviewers participating on multiple manuscripts? --
    calculate proportion that only reviewed one paper
  \item
    How does representation compare from potential to actual reviewer?
    -- seems equivalent
  \item
    Is it proportional to the author representation? -- yes
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{Figure_2.png}

\emph{Gender in Authorship} + Notes: + Proportions of men and women
authors have decreased over time, while ``unclear'' has increased -- gap
between men \& women proportions unchanged since 2012 + ratio of
women:men authors is 3:4 + First \& Middle author proportions are
representative + Last \& corresponding author proportions are
representative + Women are first authors more often than other groups --
decreasing trend of men/women first authors over time (increase of
unclear) + Trends are similar across journals \& genders + proportion of
women corresponding/last authors has not increased over time +
proportion of men senior authors has decreased over time -- increase of
unclear senior authors + proportion of published is higher for both men
\& women than submitted proportions -- means that proportion of unclear
published is lower than submitted + is the increase in published
proportions, proportionally equivalent for men \& women?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How do the proportions compare by gender at each stage of peer review?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    E.g., author, reviewer, editor, eic
  \item
    Is there variation by journal?
  \item
    Is it influenced by EiC gender?
  \item
    How often are each gender on multiple submitted or published
    manuscripts?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{Figure_3.png}

\emph{Gender Summary} + How does gender representation of manuscripts
compare from submitted to published? + proportion of M \& W authored
publications seems relatively disparate from M \& W authored submissions
-- unknown if bias + ``Publication Rate Disparity'' = (M publish rate) -
(W publish rate) -- positive == men more likely to publish (i.e.,
overperform); negative == women more likely to publish + Men overperform
in all authorship roles across ASM journals, most clear for
corresponding authors + Break it down by journals and there is clear
trend to overperformance by men in both corresponding \& last
authorships, some exceptions + Are women being retained through peer
review at the same proportion as men/unclear? + Get actual proportions
at each stage + seems as if fewer women progress through each stage than
men + large proportion of potential reviewers are not senior authors
(both genders)

\emph{Papers submitted by women are rejected more frequently than those
submitted by men}

\item
  NOTE: to correct for the large discrepency in the participation of
  women at ASM journals during the is time period, all comparisions are
  made relative to the gender and population in question.
\item
  direct comparision of the proportion of woman-authored papers that are
  rejected compared to men, at each author stage

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    middle/first author rejected at similar rates
  \item
    woman-authored (corres/last) rejected more frequently than men
  \item
    there are several journals where the overall trend is repeated
    and/or amplified (e.g., AAC, IAI, JB, mBio, MCB)
  \item
    greatest effect seen for corresponding authors, use this
    sub-population to further examine
  \end{itemize}
\item
  directly compare decisions made on submitted manuscripts by author
  gender

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    men recieve favorable decisions (accept, revise)
  \item
    most decisions are Accept, Reject, Revise -- look more closely at
    journal level
  \item
    in most cases (except msphere, msystems, CVI), rejections are more
    frequently rendered to women than men
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Both men and women editors are more likely to reject papers
authored by women than those authored by men}

\includegraphics{Figure_7.png}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are two main gatekeeping roles for manuscript decisions: editors
  \& reviewers
\item
  This section evaluates disparities made by editors during editorial
  rejections, and decisions following peer review.
\item
  Women recieve more editorial rejections than men, proportionally
  (editorial\_rejections.R)
\item
  may be complications due to geographic bias (eLife paper), restrict to
  papers submitted in US \& examine institution type
\item
  slight disparity in editorial rejection \& acceptance rates according
  to institution type (rej\_by\_inst\_type.R)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    greatest difference (4\%) occurs for institute/medical schools
  \item
    trend holds for most journals and is \textgreater{}20\% diff at JCM
    (R2s), mBio (Federal), MCB (low research), AEM (industry research)
    (Supplementary\_A)
  \item
    men from institutes/medical schools outperform women
    \textgreater{}7\% for acceptance across all journals
  \item
    \begin{quote}
    20\% in favor of men at: EC (fed researh), mSphere \& JVI (Low
    research), AEM \& MCB (industry research), JCM/JB/JCM (R2
    institution) (Supplementary\_B)
    \end{quote}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  both men \& women editors are more likely to reject women
  (editor\_gender\_analysis.R)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    men editors are more likely to make revise only \& accept decisions
    for men
  \item
    women editors highly favor men from medical schools, slightly favor
    men from R2 \& industry
  \item
    men editors favor men from R1, R2 and medical schools, slightly
    favor women from low \& industry research
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Both men and women reviewers more frequently suggest rejection for
papers authored by women}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  rev\_score\_analysis.R

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    reviewers are more likely to suggest rejections for women as
    compared to men. No difference in revise decisions (A)
  \item
    men at R1, low research, medical schools \& fed research are favored
    by reviewers over women (B)
  \end{itemize}
\item

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    both female \& male reviewers are more likely to recommend rejection
    for women. (C)
  \item
    Male reviewers are more likely to accept papers from men (C)

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Factors affecting competency}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In addition to rejectance/acceptance rates, other disparate outcomes
  may occur during the peer review process
\item
  Time in Peer Reivew (time\_to\_publication.R)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Papers published by women take slightly longer (from submission to
    ready for publication) than men at some journals (mSphere, mBio,
    mSystems, CVI, JB, JCM, AEM) despite spending similar amounts of
    time at ASM journals (A, B)
  \item
    but do not require a greater number of revisions to be accepted than
    men (Supplementary\_C)
  \item
    Papers rejected following review that were submitted by women do not
    generally take longer (in days) to be rejected (except at mSystems)
    or have more revisions (Supplementary\_D \& \_E)
  \item
    Decisions are returned to men \& women similarly (time\_at\_journ.R)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Peer review is not a linear process, it is cyclical and builds upon
  its self, may also be disparities in impact (impact\_analysis.R)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Women tend to receive lower cites per month published than men
  \item
    HTML/PDF/Abstract views are equivalent
  \item
    women are more likely to be published in lower JIF journals
  \item
    No disparity in gendered sumissions to high (mBio) vs lower
    (mSphere) journals (bias\_by\_jif.R)
  \end{itemize}

  Discuss the impact of under representation in publication

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``It {[}reviewing{]} provides positive feedback that a scholar is
    respected and participating in their field and fosters
    self-confidence, all of which lead to increased retention of women
    in geoscience'' Lerback \& Hanson, 2017
  \item
    Less diversity may reduce the diversity of perspectives \&
    approaches valued \& represented. - Fox et al, 2016
  \item
    Thus authors conclude it is an issue of female ``visibility'' versus
    ``availability''. Suggestion that being selected as a reviewer
    increases visibility, which has a direct \& significant impact on
    salary. , under-rep of W in Sci b/c of positions w. fewer resources.
    ``Participating in the peer-review process is an important way that
    early-career researchers can feel more involved with, and contribute
    to, the scientific community'' - Buckley et al, 2014
  \item
    Must be balanced w. the increased burden for department service
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Discuss literature on diversity and innovation - incentive to increase
  representation - well-documented that orgs w. more diverse \&
  equitable representation are both more inclusive \& supportive as well
  as more productive \& innovative - Potvin, 2018
\item
  Suggestions to improve representation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist

    Apply the additional suggestions from the Scientific Society health
    checklist to society journals:

      Include a visible mission/vision statement or other commitment to
      equality \& diversity that includes a non-discrimination clause
      regarding editors \& EiCs
    \item
      Collect additional data (e.g., race/ethnicity, sexual/gender
      minorities) \& present numbers publicly to maintain accountability
    \item
      Have a specific protocol for the reporting of \& responding to
      discrimination \& harassment
    \item
      Be explicit about support for women (\& other minority groups). +
      Formally (e.g., providing waivers, reduced copyediting services,
      reword to gender/location-neutral) + Informally (e.g., rewarding
      inclusive behavior by candidates, encouraging women to take up
      leadership positions, have gender-neutral, non-exclusive,
      family-friendly social activities)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Representational vs aspirational?

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Largest \& less visible workload (reviewing) should be
      representational + When choosing reviewers it may be better for
      editors to rely more on manuscript reference lists \& data base
      searches than on personal knowledge - Fox et al, 2016 + Suggest
      more women as reviewers + Improve backend/interactivity of peer
      review selection
    \item
      Higher visibility workload (editor, EiC) should be aspirational,
      recruit more women
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item

\subsection{Data and Methods}\label{data-and-methods}

\emph{Data}

All manuscripts handled by ASM journals (e.g., \emph{mBio},
\emph{Journal of Virology}) that recieved an editorial decision between
January 1st, 2012 and August 31st, 2018 were supplied as XML files by
ASM's publishing platform, eJP. Data were extracted from the XML
documents provided using R statistical software (version 3.4.4) and the
\texttt{XML} package (R citation). Data manipulation was handled using
the \texttt{tidyverse}, \texttt{lubridate}, and \texttt{xml2} packages
for R. Variables of interest included: the manuscript number assigned to
each submission, manuscript type (e.g., full length research, erratum,
editorial), category (e.g., microbial ecology), related (previously
submitted) manuscripts, versions submitted, dates (e.g., submission,
decision), author data (e.g., first, last, and corresponding
authorships, total number of authors), reviewer data (e.g., reviewer
score, recommendation, editor decision), and person data (names,
institutions, country) of the editors, authors, and reviewers.

\emph{Data analysis and presentation}

For this analysis, only original, research-based manuscripts were
included, e.g., long- and short-form research articles, New-Data
Letters, Observations, Opinion/Hypothesis articles, and Fast-Track
Communications.

It is common practice at ASM journals for manuscripts whose reviewers
recommend extensive experimental revisions be given a decision of
``reject with resubmission encouraged''. If resubmitted, the authors are
asked to note the previous (related) manuscript and the resubmission is
assigned a new manuscript number. Multiple related manuscripts were
tracked together by generating a unique grouped manuscript number based
on the recorded related manuscript numbers. This grouped manuscript
number served multiple purposes including: tracking a single manuscript
through multiple rejections or transfers between ASM journals and to
avoid duplicate counts of the same authors for the same manuscript.

Data were visualized using the \texttt{ggplot}, \texttt{scales},
\texttt{RColorBrewer}, and \texttt{ggalluvial} packages for R.

\emph{Gender prediction and assignment}

The gender assignment API genderize.io was used to predict an
indivdual's gender based on their given names, and country where
possible. The genderize.io platform uses data gathered from social media
to predict gender based on given names with the option to include an
associated language or country to enhance the odds of succesful
prediction. Since all manuscripts are submitted in English, precluding
language association for names with special characters, names were
standarized to ASCII coding (e.g., ``José'' to ``Jose''). We next
matched each individuals country against the list of X country names
accepted by genderize.io. Using the \texttt{GenderGuesser} package for
R, all unique given names associated with an accepted country were
submitted to the genderize.io API and any names returned without a
predictive assignment of either male or female were resubmitted without
an associated country. All predictive assignments of either male or
female are returned with a probability match of 0.50 or greater. The
predicted genders of all given names (with and without an associated
country) whose probabilities were greater or equal to our arbitrary
success cut off of 0.65 were used to assign predicted gender to the
individuals in our dataset. Predicted genders were assigned to
individuals in the following order: first names and country, first
names, middle names and country, middle names (Supplemental Figure 1).
The presenting gender (man/woman) of editors and senior editors in our
dataset was hand validated using Google where possible.

We recognize that biological sex (male/female) is not always equivalent
to the gender that an individual presents as (man/woman), which is also
distinct from the gender(s) that an individual may self-identify as. For
the purposes of this manuscript, we choose to focus on the presenting
gender (man/woman/unclear) based on their first names and/or appearance
(for editors). In the interest of transparency, we include those
individuals whose names don't allow a high degree of confidence for
gender assignment in the ``unclear'' category of our analysis.

\emph{Validation of gender prediction}

We first validated the algorithm using a set of 3265 names whose gender
had been hand-coded based on appearance and were generously provided to
us by \_\_\_ (preprint cite). The names were supplied to the genderize
algorithm both with and without the accompanying country data. The data
returned include the name, predicted gender (male, female, na), the
probability of correct gender assignment (ranging from 0.5 to 1.0), and
the number of instances the name and gender were associated together (1
or greater). The genderize algorithm returned gender predictions for
2899 when first names were given and 2167 when country data was also
supplied (732 names were associated with countries unsupported by
genderize).

Senstivity and specificity, are measurements of the algorithm's tendency
to return correct answers instead of false positives (e.g., a man
incorrectly gendered as a woman) or false negatives (e.g., a woman
incorrectly gendered as a man). The closer these values are to 1, the
smaller the chance that the algorithm will return the correllating false
reponse. Accuracy is a composite measure of the algorithm's ability to
differentiate the genders correctly. These measurements were calculated
from the datasets (with and without country data supplied) at three
different probability threshold cutoffs: the default genderize (0.5), a
probability threshold of 0.85 (0.85), and a modified probability of
0.85, which factors in the number of instances returned
(pmod0.85)(citations).

At the 0.5 threshold, the dataset returned a sensitivity of 0.8943 and
specificity of 0.9339 for an accuracy of 0.911, compared to a marginally
higher accuracy of 0.9146 for the dataset where country data were
included (Supplemental Table 1). Generally speaking, the accuracy
increases as the threshold increases along with slight tradeoffs between
sensitivity and specificity. For the purposes of our analysis, we opted
to use the pmod0.85 threshold moving forward (Supplemental Table 1, in
bold).

To understand the extent of geographic bias in our gender assignment
against regions and languages with genderless naming conventions, or
that lack social media for incorporation into the genderize algorithm,
we compared the number of names predicted without associated country
data to when country data was also supplied. In our test dataset, the
top five countries associated with names were United States, Germany,
United Kingdom, France, and China and the countries with the highest
proportion of un-predicted genders when country data were supplied are
Cambodia, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, and Mexico, where the maximum
number of names supplied ranged from 1 to 15. To determine the impact of
each country towards the overall percentage of names whose genders were
not predicted (27.14\%), we found the difference between the percent of
names unpredicted for each country and the overall percentage,
multiplied by the proportion of observations from that country to the
total observations and finally divided by the overall percentage of
unpredicted names (Supplemental Figure 2). The top five countries with
the greatest impact on unpredicted names, and thus the countries
recieving the most negative bias from genderize were Canada, China,
Ireland, Belgium, and Sweden (Supplemental Figure 3). These data suggest
that there is likely some bias against countries with gender-neutral
naming conventions (China), and indicates the stringency with which the
algorithm applies gender to names that are accompanied by country data.
For instance, strongly gendered names such as Peter and Pedro were not
assigned gender when associated with Canada.

We next applied the genderize algorithm at the pmod0.85 threshold to our
journals dataset and tested its validity on a small portion. All first
names collected from our dataset were submitted to genderize both with
and without country data. Only those predictions whose pmod were
equvalent or greater than 0.85 were carried to the next step. The
predicted genders were assigned to individuals in the following order:
first names and country, first names, middle names and country, middle
names. Given the relatively small number of editors and senior editors
in our dataset, the presenting gender (man/woman) of editors and senior
editors in our dataset was hand-validated using Google where possible.
Of the 1072 editor names, 938 were predicted by genderize for an
accuracy of 0.9989339, thus increasing our confidence in the gender
predictions where made.

In our full dataset, the five countries with the most individuals were
United States, China, Japan, France, and Germany and the countries with
the highest proportion of un-predicted genders were Burundi, Chad,
Kingman Reef, Korea (North), Democratic People's Republic of, and
Maldives, where the maximum number of names supplied ranged from 1 to 4.
Proportionally, fewer names in our full dataset were assigned gender
than in our validation dataset (40.01\% unpredicted versus 27.14\%
unpredicted, respectively). Since adjusting the workflow to predict the
gender of names both with and without country data, the countries
recieving the most negative bias from genderize were China, Japan,
Korea, Republic of, India, Taiwan, Province of China (Supplemental
Figure 4). These data indicate what we previously predicted, that the
genderize algorithm has bias against countries with gender-neutral
naming conventions.
