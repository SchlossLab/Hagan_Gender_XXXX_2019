\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Evidence has accumulated over the decades that academic research has a
representation problem. While at least 50\% of biology Ph.D.~graduates
are women, the number of women in postdoctoral positions and
tenure-track positions are below 40\% and 30\%, respectively. Recently,
scientific societies and publishers have begun examining internal
submissions data to evaluate representation of, or bias against, women
in their peer review processes; however, representation and attitudes
differ by scientific field and no studies to-date seem to have
investigated academic publishing in the field of microbiology. Using
manuscripts submitted between January 2012 and August 2018 to 13
journals published by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), we
describe the representation of women at ASM journals and the outcomes of
their manuscripts. We find that senior women authors at ASM journals are
underrepresented compared to global and society estimates of
microbiology researchers. Additionally, manuscripts submitted by
corresponding authors that were women, received more negative outcomes
(e.g., editorial rejections, reviewer recommendations, and decisions
after review), than those submitted by men. These negative outcomes were
somewhat mediated by whether or not the corresponding author was based
in the US or not, and by the institution for US-based authors.
Nonetheless, the pattern for women corresponding authors to receive more
negative outcomes for their submitted manuscripts indicates a pattern of
gender-influenced editorial decisions. We conclude with suggestions to
improve the representation of, and decrease bias against, women at ASM
journals.

\subsection{Importance}\label{importance}

Women are underrepresented as senior scientists at ASM journals. This is
due to a combination of both low submissions from senior women authors
and increased rejection rates for women compared to men.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Evidence has accumulated over the decades that academic research has a
representation problem. While at least 50\% of biology Ph.D.~graduates
are women, the number of women in postdoctoral positions and
tenure-track positions are less than 40 and 30\%, respectively (1).
Studies examining other metrics such as race and ethnicity found that in
2011, less than 27\% of all science and engineering doctorates were
awarded to underrepresented minorities, and less than 25\% of associate
professors identified as non-white (2, 3). Predictably, the disparities
increase with academic rank (4). There have been many proposed reasons
for these disparities, particularly with regards to women, which include
biases in training and hiring, the impact of children on career
trajectories, a lack of support for primary caregivers, a lack of
recognition, lower perceived competency, and less productivity as
measured by research publications (1, 5--9). These issues do not act
independent of each other, instead they accumulate for both individuals
and the community, much as advantages do (10, 11). Accordingly,
addressing these issues necessitates multi-level approaches from all
institutions and members of the scientific community.

Scientific societies play an integral role in the formation and
maintenance of scientific communities. They host conferences that
provide a forum for knowledge exchange, networking, and opportunities
for increased visibility as a researcher. Scientific societies also
frequently publish the most reputable journals in their field,
facilitating the peer review process to vet new research
submissions(12). Recently, scientific societies and publishers have
begun examining internal submissions data to evaluate representation of,
and bias against, women in their peer review processes. The American
Geological Union found that while the acceptance rate of women-authored
publications was greater than publications authored by men, women
submitted fewer manuscripts than men and were used as reviewers only
20\% of the time (13), a factor influenced by the gender of the editor
(14). Several other studies have concluded that there is no significant
bias against papers authored by women (14--18). Two recent studies---one
of the peer review process at \emph{eLife}, a broad scope biology
journal, and the other of outcomes at six ecology and evolution
journals---found that women-authored papers are less likely to have
positive peer reviews and outcomes (19, 20).

The representation of women scientists and gender attitudes differ by
scientific field and no studies to-date have investigated academic
publishing in the field of microbiology. The American Society for
Microbiology (ASM) is one of the largest life science societies, with an
average membership of 41,000 since 1990. In its mission statement, the
ASM notes that it is ``an inclusive organization, engaging with and
responding to the needs of its diverse constituencies'' and pledges to
``address all members' needs through development and assessment of
programs and services.'' One of these services is the publication of
microbiology research through a suite of research and review journals.
Between January 2012 and August 2018, ASM published \textbf{X papers
accross} 15 different journals: \emph{Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy} (AAC), \emph{Applied and Environmental Microbiology}
(AEM), \emph{Clinical and Vaccine Immunology} (CVI), \emph{Clinical
Microbiology Reviews} (CMR), \emph{Eukaryotic Cell} (EC),
\emph{Infection and Immunity} (IAI), \emph{Journal of Bacteriology}
(JB), \emph{Journal of Clinical Microbiology} (JCM), \emph{Journal of
Virology} (JV), \emph{mBio}, \emph{Microbiology and Molecular Biology
Reviews} (MMBR), \emph{Genome Announcements} (GA, now \emph{Microbiology
Resource Annoucements}), \emph{Molecular and Cellular Biology} (MCB),
\emph{mSphere}, and \emph{mSystems}. The goal of this research study was
to describe the population of ASM journals through the gender-based
representation of authors, reviewers, and editors and the associated
peer review outcomes.

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

Over 100,000 manuscript records were obtained for the period between
January 2012 and August 2018 (Fig. 1). Each of these were evaluated by
reviewers and/or editors, leading to multiple possible outcomes.
Manuscripts may be immediately rejected by editors instead of being sent
to peer review, often due to issues of scope or quality. These were
defined as editorial rejections and identified as manuscripts rejected
without review. Alternately, editors send many manuscripts out for
review by two or three experts in the field selected from a list of
potential reviewers suggested by the authors and/or editors. Reviewers
give feedback to the authors and editor, who decides whether the
manuscript in question should be accepted, rejected, or sent back for
revision. At ASM journals, manuscripts with suggested revisions that are
expected to take more than 30 days are rejected, but generally
encouraged to resubmit. If resubmitted, the authors are asked to note
the previous (related) manuscript and the re-submission is assigned a
new manuscript number. Multiple related manuscripts were tracked
together by generating a unique grouped manuscript number based on the
recorded related manuscript numbers. This grouped manuscript number
served dual purposes of tracking a single manuscript through multiple
rejections and avoiding duplicate counts of authors for a single
manuscript. After eliminating non-primary research manuscripts and
linking records for resubmitted manuscripts, there were 81,897 unique
manuscripts processed (Fig. 1).

We assigned genders to both peer review gatekeepers (e.g.,
editor-in-chief, editors, reviewers) and authors on the original
research manuscripts evaluated during this time period using a
classification algorithim (Supp Text). We recognize that biological sex
(male/female) is not always equivalent to the gender that an individual
presents as (man/woman), which is also distinct from the gender(s) that
an individual may self-identify as. For the purposes of this manuscript,
we choose to focus on the presenting gender (man/woman/unknown) based on
their first names (and appearance for editors). Author genders were
assigned using a social media-informed predictive algorithm with
stringent criteria and validation process (see methods). In addition to
identifying journal participants as men or women, this method of gender
assignment resulted in a category of individuals whose gender could not
be reliably predicted (i.e., unknown). Among the individuals classified
as either men or women, the sensitivity and specificity were \textbf{X}
when validated against a curated set of authors and editors (Supp Text).

In the interest of transparency, we include those individuals whose
names don't allow a high degree of confidence for gender assignment in
the ``unknown'' category of our analysis, which is shown in many of the
plots depicting representation of the population, but are not included
in the comparison of manuscript outcomes.

\textbf{Men dominate as gatekeepers and senior authors.} We first
evaluated the representation of men and women who were gatekeepers
during the study period. Each journal is led by an editor-in-chief (EIC)
who manages journal scope and quality standards through a board of
editors with field expertise that handle the peer review process. There
were 17 EICs, 17.65\% of which were women. Two journals, EC and CVI were
retired during the period under study. Four years before retirement, the
leadership of CVI transferred from a man EIC, to a woman while JVI has
had a woman as EIC since 2012. The total number of editors at all ASM
journals combined over the duration of our study (senior editors and
editors pooled) was 1015, 28.77\% of which were women.

Over 40\% of both men and women editors were from US-based R1
institutions, defined as doctoral universities with very high research
activity, with non-US institutions, and U.S. medical schools or research
institutions supplying the next largest proportions of editors (Fig.
2A). Since 2012, there was a slow trend toward equivalent gender
representation among editors (Fig. 2B). The trends for each journal
studied vary considerably, though most have slow trends toward parity
(Fig. S1). CVI and \emph{mSphere} were the only ASM journals to have
accomplished equivalent representation of both genders, with CVI having
a greater proportion of women editors than men before it was retired. EC
was the only journal with an increasing parity gap.

Altogether, 30439 reviewers submitted reviews. Of those to whom we could
assign a gender, 24.63\% were women. The greatest proportion of
reviewers (over 50\% of both men and women) came from non-US
institutions, while R1 institutions supplied the next largest cohort of
reviewers (Fig. 2C). The proportions of each gender was steady among
reviewers at ASM journals (Fig. 2D) and was representative of both the
suggested reviewers at all journals combined, and the actual reviewer
proportions at most journals (Fig. S2).

\textbf{Editorial workloads were not proportionate} Across all journals,
men handled a slightly greater proportion of manuscripts than women,
relative to their respective editorial representations (Fig. 3A). This
trend continued across most journals with varying degrees of difference
between workload and representation (Fig. S1). For instance, at
\emph{mSphere}, workload and proportions were identical; however, CVI,
\emph{mBio}, and JVI, each had periods at which the workload for women
editors was much higher than their representation, with corresponding
decreases in the workload of men. In the years preceding its retirement,
the representation of women at CVI increased, decreasing the gap in
editorial workload. However, representations and relative workloads for
men and women editors at JVI have held steady over time, while the
proportionate workload for women at \emph{mBio} has increased.

The median number of manuscripts reviewed by men, women, and unknown
individuals was 2, for all groups. Half of those in the men, women, or
unknown gender groups reviewed between one and 5, 4, or 3 manuscripts
each, respectively (Fig. 3B). Conversely, 44.6\% of men, 40.05\% of
women, and 48.61\% of unknown gendered reviewers reviewed only one
manuscript. Reviewers of all genders accepted fewer requests to review
from women editors (average of 47.79\%) than from men (average of
53.34\%) and were less likely to respond to women editors than men (no
response rate averages of 25.06 and 19.8566667\%, respectively) (Fig.
3C). Editors of both genders contacted reviewers from all three gender
groups at equivalent proportions, though women editors contact an
average of 76.43\% of suggested reviewers, while men contact 74.07\% on
average (Fig. 3D).

\textbf{Women were underrepresented as authors} Globally, microbiology
researchers are 60\% men and 40\% women (21). In September 2018, 38.37\%
of ASM members who reported their gender were women. We wanted to
determine if these proportions were similar for authors at ASM journals
and to understand the distribution of each gender among submitted
manuscripts and published papers. We began by describing author
institutions by gender. Over 60\% of submitting authors were from non-US
institutions, followed by 20\% from R1 institutions (Fig. 4A). The
proportions of men and women authors at ASM have decreased over time at
equivalent rates, as the proportion of unknown gendered authors has
increased, with a ratio of men to women authors of 4:3 (i.e., 57\% men)
(Fig. 4B).

In the field of microbiology, order of authorship on manuscripts signals
the type and magnitude of contributions to the finished product with
first and last authorship being the most prestigious. First authors are
generally trainees (e.g., students or post-docs) or early career
research responsible for the bulk of the project, while last authors are
lead investigators, supplying conceptual guidance and resources to
complete the project. Middle authors are generally responsible for
technical analyses and methods. Any author can also be a corresponding
author, which we identified as the individual responsible for
communicating with publishing staff during peer review (as opposed to an
author to whom readers direct questions).

The proportion of manuscripts submitted with men and women first authors
have remained constant with averages of 29.1 and 30.7 percent,
respectively (Fig. 4C, dashed). Their respective proportions of average
published papers were nearly identical at 33.07\% for men and 33.78\%
for women. The proportion of submitted manuscripts with men
corresponding authors has remained steady at an average of 41.58\% and
the proportion with women corresponding authors was at 23.45\% (Fig. 4D,
dashed). Both men and women corresponding authors have a greater
proportion of papers published than manuscripts submitted, just as
manuscripts with corresponding authors of unknown gender were rejected
at a higher rate. The difference between submitted manuscripts and
published papers where men were corresponding authors is 8.18, but only
0.93 where women were corresponding authors. This trend is similar for
middle and last authors (Fig. S3).

Of 38594 multi-author manuscripts submitted by men corresponding
authors, 23.46\% had zero women authors. In contrast, 7253 (36.34\%) of
manuscripts submitted by women corresponding authors had a majority of
the authors as women, exceeding those submitted by men corresponding
authors in both the number (3247) and percent (8.41) of submissions.
Additionally, the proportion of women authors decreased as the number of
authors increases (Fig. S4). Men submitted \textbf{X} single-authored
manuscripts while \textbf{X} single-authored manuscripts were submitted
by women.

We hypothesized that we would be able to predict the gender of the
corresponding author from the manuscript metadata. We trained a logistic
regression model to predict the gender of the corresponding author using
whether or not the corresponding author's institution was in the U.S.,
the total number of authors, the proportion of authors that were women,
whether or not the paper was published, the gender of senior editors and
editors, the number of revisions, and whether or not the manuscript was
editorially rejected as variables to train our model. We measure the
model's performance using the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC). The AUROC value is a predictive
performance metric that ranges from 0.0, where the model's predictions
are completely wrong, to 1.0, where the model perfectly distinguishes
between outcomes. A value of 0.5 indicates the model did not perform
better than random. The median AUROC value of our model to predict
corresponding author gender was 0.7. The variable with the largest
weight (i.e., the most predictive value), in our model was the
proportion of women authors. These results indicate that manuscript
submission data was capable of predicting the gender of the
corresponding author, but that prediction is primarily driven by what
percentage of authors are women.

As described above, first authors were slightly more likely to be women
(30.7 vs 23.45), but corresponding authors were more likely to be men (X
vs X). A concern is that if authors are not retained so they transition
from junior to senior status, they are also left out of the gatekeeping
roles. \textbf{{[}Add justification for first/middle authors as junior
based on authorship conventions{]}} There were 75451 women who
participated as junior authors (first/middle) at ASM journals. Of those
junior authors who were women, 8.21\% also participated as senior
authors (last/corresponding), 8.9\% were suggested reviewers and 5.38\%
participated as reviewers. 0.25\% of women junior authors were also
editors at ASM journals. For men, there were a total of 83727 junior
authors, where 13.56\% also participated as senior authors, 16.69\%
considered as reviewers, and 11.08\% actually reviewed. 0.66 of men
junior authors were also editors at ASM journals. Overall, women were
half as likely to move to more prestigious (e.g., senior author,
gatekeeper) roles in peer review than men.

\textbf{Manuscripts submitted by women have more negative outcomes than
those submitted by men.} To better understand the differences between
published and submitted proportions for men and women authors (Fig. 4CD,
Fig. S3), we compared the rejection rates of men and women at each
author stage (first, middle, corresponding, and last). Middle authors
were rejected at similar rates for men and women, a 0 percentage point
difference across all journals; however, manuscripts with senior women
authors were rejected more frequently than those authored by men with
-1.64 and -0.92 percentage point differences for corresponding and last
authors, respectively (Fig. 5A, vertical line). There were several
instances where the overall trend was repeated at the journal level
(e.g., AAC, IAI, JB, \emph{mBio}, MCB). The greatest differences were
observed when comparing the outcome of corresponding authors by gender,
so we used this sub-population to further examine the difference in
manuscript acceptance and rejection rates between men and women.

We next compared the rejection rates for men and women corresponding
authors after two bottlenecks, initial review by the editor and the
first round of peer review. Manuscripts authored by women were
editorially rejected as much as 12 percentage points more often than
those authored by men (Fig. 5B). The percentage point difference at all
ASM journals combined was -3.82 (vertical line). MCB and \emph{mBio},
had the most extreme percentage point differences. Manuscripts authored
by men and women were equally likely to be accepted after the first
round of review (Fig. 5C, right panel). However, women-authored papers
were rejected more often (left panel) while men-authored papers were
more often given revision decisions (center panel). JB, AAC, and MCB had
the most extreme differences rejection and revision decisions, (-5.6 and
5.55 respectively; Fig. 5C vertical lines). Percentage point differences
were not correlated with journal prestige as measured by impact factors
(R\({^2}\) = -0.022, P = ?). This suggests the authors of women-authored
papers spent more time making revisions than those of men-authored
papers.

In addition to manuscript decisions, other disparate outcomes may occur
during the peer review process (22). To determine whether accepted
women-authored manuscripts spent more time between being submitted and
being ready for publication, we compared the number of revisions, days
spent in the ASM peer review system, and the number of days from
submission to being ready for publication to those authored by men.
Manuscripts authored by women took slightly longer (from submission to
ready for publication) than men at some journals (\emph{mSphere},
\emph{mBio}, \emph{mSystems}, CVI, JB, JCM, AEM) despite spending
similar amounts of time in the ASM journal peer review system (Fig. S5),
and having the same median number of revisions prior to acceptance
(Median = X, IQR = X-X).

To understand how gatekeeper (editor/reviewer) genders influence
decisions (e.g., Fig. 5C), we grouped editor decisions and reviewer
suggestions according to the gatekeeper gender. Both men and women
editors rejected proportionally more women-authored papers, however the
difference in decisions were more extreme for men-edited manuscripts
(Fig. 6A). Reviewers were more likely to suggest rejection for
women-authored manuscripts as compared to men, although a minimal
difference in revise recommendations was observed (Fig. 6B). Both men
and women reviewers recommended rejection more often for women-authored
manuscripts although men recommended acceptance more often for
men-authored manuscripts (Fig. 6C). Women reviewers suggested revision
on women-authored papers more often than men-authored manuscripts.
\textbf{{[}These data suggest that women reviewers made more negative
decisions towards manuscripts from women-authored manuscripts than
reviewers who were men -- not sure I agree w. this{]}}.

To evaluate if gender played a role in manuscript editorial decisions,
we trained a L2-regularized logistic regression model to predict whether
or not a manuscript was reviewed (i.e.~editorially rejected or not). We
used the genders of senior editor, editor, and corresponding author, as
well as the proportion of authors that were women as variables to train
the model. The median AUROC value was 0.61, which indicated that
editorial decisions were not random, however, the AUROC value is
relatively low indicating that there are factors other than the
variables we included in our model that influence editorial decisions.

\textbf{Country and institute of origin contribute to overperformance by
men.} The associateion between gender and manuscript decision could be
attributed to gender bias by journal gatekeepers, however, there are
other types of bias that may contribute to, or obscure, overt gender
bias; for instance, a recent evaluation of peer-review outcomes at
\emph{eLife} found evidence of preference for research submitted by
authors from their own country or region (19). Other studies have
documented prestige bias, where men are over-represented in more
prestigious (i.e., more respected and competent) programs (23). It is
therefore possible, that what seems to be gender bias could be
geographic or prestige bias interacting with the increased proportion of
women submitting from outside the US or at lower prestige institutions
(e.g., low research institutions) (Fig. 4A).

To quantify how these factors affect manuscript decisions, we next
looked at the outcome of manuscripts submitted only by corresponding
authors at US institutions \textbf{{[}what \% of women authors in US vs
non-US{]}}, because these institutions represented the majority of
manuscripts and are classified by the Carnegie Foundation. When only
considering US-based authors, the difference in percentage points for
editorial rejections increased from -3.82 to -1.46 (Fig. 7A). Similarly,
the difference in percentage point trends of decisions after review for
US-based authors mirror those seen for all corresponding authors at the
journal level (Fig. 7B). The over-performance of women in rejection
decisions increased from -5.6 to -4.36, and the over-performance of men
in revise only decisions decreased from 5.55 to 4.22 (Fig. 7B). The rate
of accept decisions changed from -1.46 to 0.12 after restricting the
analysis to US-based authors. These results suggest that the country of
origin (e.g, US versus not) accounted for some gender bias, particularly
for editorial rejections.

To address institution-based prestige bias, we split the US-based
corresponding authors according to the type of institution they were
affiliated with and re-evaluated the differences for men and women.
Editorial rejections occurred \textbf{{[}what \% women authors by inst
type{]}} most often for women from medical schools or institutes,
followed by those from R2 institutions (Fig. 7C). Manuscripts submitted
by men from medical schools or institutes were accepted proportionally
more often than those submitted by women. The difference for
corresponding authors from medical schools or institutes seems to be
spread across most ASM journals, while the editorial rejection of papers
from R2 institutions seems to be driven primarily by JCM (Fig. S6AB).

To evaluate if these factors affect manuscript decisions, we trained a
L2-regularized regression model to predict if a manuscript was
editorially rejected or not, using the variables: origin (US vs non),
institution (US institution type), number of authors, proportion of
authors that were women, and the genders of both gatekeepers and
authors. The model had a median AUROC value of 0.67 which indicated that
there was a non-random interaction between these factors and editorial
decisions. Manuscripts from authors at U.S. ``other'' institutions, men
EICs, men that are corresponding authors from ``other'' U.S.
institutions, and women from medical schools and institutes were more
associated with editorial rejections (Fig. S6D). Conversely, manuscripts
from R1 institutions, authors from the U.S., EiCs that were women, and
the number of authors were more likely to be associated with review
(Fig. S6D). These results confirm that the country of origin and class
of institutions impact decisions in a non-random manner
\textbf{{[}\textgreater{} or \textless{} than gender?{]}}.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

We described the representation of men and women at ASM journals between
January 2012 and August 2018 and compared editorial outcomes according
to the authors' gender. Women were consistently under-represented (30\%
or less in all levels of the peer review process) excluding first
authors, where women represented were about 50\% of authors where we
could assign a gender (Fig. 2/4). Women and men editors had
proportionate workloads across all ASM journals combined, but those
workloads were disproportionate at the journal level and the
overburdened gender varied according to the journal (Fig. 3/S1).
Additionally, manuscripts submitted by corresponding authors that were
women, received more negative outcomes (e.g., editorial rejections),
than those submitted by men (Fig. 5/6). These negative outcomes were
somewhat mediated by whether the corresponding author was based in the
US and by the type of institution for US-based authors (Fig. 7).
However, the trend for women corresponding authors to receive more
negative outcomes held, indicating a pattern of gender-influenced
editorial decisions regardless of journal prestige (as determined by
impact factor).

While the proportion of women as first authors is higher than data
obtained globally and from self-reported ASM membership data, which in
turn was higher than the proportion of senior women authors at ASM
journals. Only half as many women who were junior authors at ASM
journals were also senior authors when compared to men, and the
representation of women decreased as the prestige (e.g., reviewer,
editor) increased. These trends are consistent with representation of
senior women in academic biological sciences and the observation that
women are more likely to leave academia during the transition from
postdoc to investigator (24). These data indicate that microbiology (as
represented by ASM journals) is not exempt from the issues that limit
the retention of women through academic ranks.

How to define representation and determine what the leadership should
look like are recurring questions in STEM. Ideally, the representation
for men and women corresponding authors, reviewers, and editors would
reflect the number of Ph.D.s awarded (about 50\% each, when considered
on a binary spectrum). We argue that the goal should depend on the
workload and visibility of the position(s). Since high visibility
positions (e.g., editor, EIC) are filled by a smaller number of
individuals that are responsible for recruiting more individuals into
leadership, filling these positions should be done aspirationally (i.e.,
50\% should be women if the goal were an aspirational leadership). This
allows greater visibility for women as experts, expansion of the
potential reviewer network, and recruitment into those positions
(25--27). Conversely, lower visibility positions (e.g., reviewers)
require a greater number of individuals and should thus be
representational of the field to avoid overburdening the minority
population (i.e., since 23.5\% of corresponding authors to ASM journals
are women, then 20-25\% of reviewers should be women). Balancing the
workload is particularly important given the literature indicating that
women faculty have higher institutional service loads than their
counterparts who are men (28).

In contrast to institutional service, the editing workload at ASM
journals seems to be predominantly borne by men. A possible explanation
for the difference in gatekeeper representation and editor workloads is
that women are more likely to conduct research on the fringes of
research fields (29--31). Their separation from the traditional center
of a field decreases their perceived competency, which could result in
research typecasting and lower manuscript handling responsibilities. Any
of these situations can be compounded by the increased proportion of
potential reviewers that either do not accept, or do not respond to,
requests to review from women editors. This increases the proportion of
reviewers that women editors must contact, adding additional time and
work to their editorial burdens. Three journals, \emph{mBio}, CVI, and
JVI are exceptions with regards to editorial workloads. At these
journals, the editorial workloads of women exceeds their representation.
A possible explanation for CVI and JVI is that both of these journals
have been led by women EICs. Alternately, the tendency for reviewers to
reject requests to review from editors that are women extends to editors
that are men rejecting requests to handle manuscripts from EiCs that are
women. Our data differ from those of Fox, Burns, and Meyer who found
that the gender of the editor influenced the gender of the contacted
reviewers, but supports findings that women editors contact more
reviewers than men (14, 32).

Our data support findings of previous studies that women are more likely
to collaborate with other women (33). In our linear regression models,
the number of authors on a manuscript was the largest contributor to
avoiding editorial rejections, suggesting that highly collaborative
research is preferred by editors, an observation supported by the
increase of citations with author count (34). It is, therefore,
disturbing that when the number of authors exceeded 30 on a manuscript
\textbf{{[}N=?{]}}, the proportion of individuals identified as women
was always below 51\%, despite equivalent numbers of trainees in the
biological sciences (Fig. S4). Additionally, while women corresponding
authors submit fewer manuscripts, more of them (both numerically and
proportionally), have a majority of women co-authors, compared to those
submitted by men corresponding authors. Previous research suggests that
women who collaborate with other women receive less credit for these
publications than when they collaborate with men (35), and that women
are more likely to yield corresponding authorship to colleagues that are
men (20). The gender-based segregation of collaborations at ASM journals
likely has consequences in pay and promotion and could be a factor in
the decreased retention of senior women at ASM journals.

The under representation of women as corresponding authors in
publication at ASM journals may have negative consequences for their
careers and microbiology, since their role as senior author can impact
their status in the field. Buckley et al, suggested that being selected
as a reviewer increases visibility of a researcher, which has a direct
and significant impact on salary (18). Therefore, the under
representation of women as senior authors and reviewers likely hampers
their career progression and even their desire to progress since status
in the peer review process also signals adoption of the researcher into
the scientific community (18). Retention of women in science is
important to the progress of microbiology since less diversity in
science limits the diversity of perspectives and approaches, thus
stunting the search for knowledge. In addition to boosting productivity
and knowledge, more diverse and equitable organizations are more
inclusive and supportive for all members (4).

The support of academic research journals for women has been the topic
of many papers, which note the lack of women authors relative to men
(36--39). However, submissions data is required to determine if the lack
of representation is due to low submissions or bias during peer review.
We have shown that there is a disparity in submissions from senior women
in microbiology compared to men, but this does not fully account for the
difference in publications by men and women corresponding authors at ASM
journals. There is also a consistent trend favoring positive outcomes
for manuscripts submitted by corresponding authors that are men.
Manuscripts submitted by corresponding authors who are women are
editorially rejected at greater rates, and gatekeepers of both genders
favor revisions for manuscripts authored by men but rejection for those
authored by women. Neither geographic (e.g., US or not) nor institution
type can fully account for the gender-based bias observed. Instead, the
presence of bias favoring men over women from U.S. R1 institutions and
medical schools and institutes suggests that the bias persists even in
environments with generally excellent resources and infrastructure for
research. The scientific endeavor and peer review system select for
decisions that are often based on the assumption that scientists are
objective, impartial experts. As a result, scientists who believe
themselves immune to biases are making decisions that rely on biases to
speed the process. The types of biases at play and their potential roles
in peer review are well documented (40, 41). For instance, previous
studies document that a greater burden of proof is required for women to
achieve similar competency as men and that women are less likely to
self-promote (and are penalized if they do) (8, 42, 43). These might
lead women to be more conservative in manuscript submissions, making the
observed bias even more concerning.

Even if a gatekeeper does not know the corresponding author or their
gender, there remain ample avenues for implicit bias during peer review.
The stricter standard of competency has led women to adopt different
writing styles from men, resulting in manuscripts with increased
explanations, detail, and readability than those authored by men (22,
44). These differences in writing can act as subtle cues to the author's
gender. Additionally, significant time, funds, and staff are required to
be competitive in highly active fields (e.g., \emph{Clostridium
difficile}, HIV), but women are often at a disadvantage for these
resources due to the cumulative affects of bias (10, 11). As a result,
corresponding authors that are women may be spending their resources at
the fringes of research fields where competition impacts are mitigated.
This has the disadvantage of further decreasing perceived competency of
these women scientists to those at the established center of the field
(29--31). Alternatively, reserach on the fringes may be seen as less
impactful, leading to poorer outcomes. These observations are reflected
in our data, since while the number of revisions before publication is
identical for both men and women, manuscripts authored by women have
increased rejection rates and time spent on revision. This suggests that
manuscripts submitted by women receive more involved critiques (i.e.,
work) from reviewers and/or their competency to complete revisions
within the prescribed 30 days is doubted, when compared to men. Women
may also feel they need to do more to meet expectations leading to
longer periods between a decision and resubmission.

\textbf{{[}Few papers have found disparities between rejection rates of
men and women and to our knowledge, this is the first paper to
collectively examine this issue with either meta-submissions data from
this many journals or on the field of microbiology. - simplify/break
up{]}} A limitation to our methodology is the use of an algorithm to
assign gender by first names, which left us with a category of unknown
gendered individuals. \textbf{{[}another factor is how a name presents
the gender of the person??{]}} The increase in unknown gendered authors
corresponds to an increase in submissions to ASM journals from Asian
countries, particularly China. Anecdotally, most editorial rejections
are of poor quality papers from Asia and our method has low performance
on non-gendered languages from this region (see Supplemental Text). As a
result, many manuscripts from Asia were excluded from the analysis on
decision outcomes, increasing our confidence that the trends observed
are gender-based. Another concern might be the small effect size
observed in many analyses. Nonetheless, the consistency of decisions to
benefit men corresponding authors over women, across all journals
included in this study, in addition to accumulated literature to-date,
confirms that this descriptive study is highly relevant for the ASM as a
society. Our findings offer opportunities to address gendered
representation in microbiology and systemic barriers to peer review at
our journals.

All parties have an opportunity and obligation to advance
underrepresented groups in science (4). We suggest the development of a
visible mission, vision, or other commitment to equity and inclusion
that includes a non-discrimination clause regarding decisions made by
editors and editors-in-chief. This non-discrimination clause would be
backed by a specific protocol for the reporting of, and responding to,
instances of discrimination and harassment. Second, society journals
should begin collecting additional data about authors and gatekeepers
(e.g., race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, and
disabilities). Such author data should not be readily available to
journal gatekeepers, but instead kept in a disaggregated manner that
allows the public presentation to track success of inclusive measures
and maintain accountability. Third, society journals can implement
mechanisms to explicitly provide support for women and other minority
groups, reward inclusive behavior by gatekeepers, nominate more women to
leadership positions and recruit manuscripts from sub-fields that are
more likely to attract women and HURMs. Gatekeepers, and authors, can
help advance women (and other minority groups) within the peer review
system by changing how they select experts in their field. For instance,
authors can suggest more women as reviewers using ``Diversify''
resources, while reviewers can agree to review for women editors more
often (45). Editors can rely more on manuscript reference lists and data
base searches than personal knowledge, and journals can improve the
interactivity and functionality of the peer review selection software
(46). Growing evidence suggests that represntation problems in STEM are
due to retention rather than recruitment. We need to align journal
practices to foster the retention of women and URM.

Addressing bias (gender, geographic, prestige, or otherwise) during peer
review process is a more difficult challenge, since it is partially the
result of accumulated disadvantages and the actions resulting from
implicit biases. Most approaches to overcomming these issues focus on
choices made by individuals, such as double-blinded reviews and implicit
bias training, but these cannot fully remedy the effects of bias and may
even worsen outcomes (47, 48).

Broadly, peer review is a nebulous process with expectations and
outcomes that vary considerably, even within a single journal. Academic
writing courses suffer similar issues and have sought to remedy them
through the use of rubrics. When implemented correctly, rubrics can
reduce bias during evaluation and enhance the evaluation process for
both the evaluator and the evaluatee (49--52). We argue that rubrics
could be implemented in the peer review process to both focus reviewer
comments, clarify editorial decisions, and improve the author
experience. Such rubrics should increase the emphasis on \textbf{solid}
research, as opposed to novel or ``impactful'' research, the latter of
which is a highly subjective measure (53, 54). This might also serve to
change the overall attitude toward replicatitive research and negative
results, thus bolstering the field through reproduciblity. We also argue
that reconsidering journal scope and expanding editorial boards might
help address structural barriers bias against women in peer review.
Expanding journal scope and adding more handling editors would improve
the breadth of research published, thus providing a home for more
non-traditional research fields (the case at mSphere with an increased
pool of editors). Implementing these steps to decrease bias--review
rubrics, increased focus on solid research, expansion of journal scopes,
and editorial boards--will also standardize competency standards for
researchers at ASM journals and improve microbiology as a whole.

We hope that this report will help to counteract the bias against women
through the transparency of accountability that provides our gatekeepers
with the evidence of bias. However, the adaptation of women (and other
minority groups) to bias (e.g., area of research and communication
styles), make it impossible to level the playing field at the individual
level. We must also work to change the fundamental structure and goals
of peer review to minimize bias.

\subsection{Data and Methods}\label{data-and-methods}

\textbf{Data} All manuscripts handled by ASM journals (e.g.,
\emph{mBio}, \emph{Journal of Virology}) that received an editorial
decision between January 1, 2012 and August 31, 2018 were supplied as
XML files by ASM's publishing platform, eJP. Data were extracted from
the XML documents provided, manipulated, and visualized using R
statistical software (version 3.4.4) and relevant packages (55--69).
Variables of interest included: the manuscript number assigned to each
submission, manuscript type (e.g., full length research, erratum,
editorial), category (e.g., microbial ecology), related (i.e.,
previously submitted) manuscripts, number of versions submitted, dates
(e.g., submission, decision), author data (e.g., first, last, and
corresponding authorship, total number of authors), reviewer data (e.g.,
reviewer score, recommendation, editor decision), and personal data
(names, institutions, country) of the editors, authors, and reviewers.
For this analysis, only original, research-based manuscripts were
included, e.g., long- and short-form research articles, New-Data
Letters, Observations, Opinion/Hypothesis articles, and Fast-Track
Communications. To help protect the confidentiality of peer review,
names have been removed from all records.

\textbf{Institution classification} To identify the communities
represented, we used Carnegie classifications to group US-based academic
institutions into R1 research (very high research activity), R2 research
(high research activity), four-year medical schools, or low research
(i.e., not R1, R2, or medical school) (70). Research institutes (e.g.,
Mayo Clinic, Cold Springs Harbor), industry (e.g., pharmaceutical), and
federal (e.g., NIH, CDC) research groups were identified using the
internet. Four-year medical schools and research institutions were
grouped together since these typically share research prestige and have
considerable resources to support research. Industry and federal
research were grouped separately. The ``Other'' category represents
uncategorized US institutions. Non-US institutions were a category on
their own.

\textbf{Gender prediction and assignment} The gender assignment API
genderize.io was used to predict an individual's gender based on their
given names and country where possible. The genderize.io platform uses
data gathered from social media to predict gender based on given names
with the option to include an associated language or country to enhance
the odds of successful prediction. Since all manuscripts are submitted
in English, precluding language association for names with special
characters, names were standardized to ASCII coding (e.g., ``José'' to
``Jose''). We next matched each individuals' country against the list of
242 country names accepted by genderize.io. Using the GenderGuesser
package for R (71), all unique given names associated with an accepted
country were submitted to the genderize.io API and any names returned
without a predictive assignment of either male or female were
resubmitted without an associated country. The data returned include the
name, predicted gender (male, female, no prediction), the probability of
correct gender assignment (ranging from 0.5 to 1.0), and the number of
instances the name and gender were associated together (1 or greater).
The predicted genders of all given names (with and without an associated
country) whose probabilities were greater or equal to a modified
probability (pmod) of 0.85 were used to assign predicted genders to the
individuals in our data set (see Supplemental Text). Predicted genders
were assigned to individuals in the following order: first names and
country, first names, middle names and country, middle names (Fig. S7).
The presenting gender (man/woman) of editors and senior editors in our
data set was hand verified using Google where possible and the algorithm
validated using published data (7).

\textbf{Manuscript outcome analysis} To better visualize and understand
the differences in outcomes according to author gender, we calculated
the difference in percentage points between the proportion of that
outcome for men and women. To correct for the disparity in the
participation of women relative to men at ASM journals, all percentage
point comparisons are made relative to the gender and population in
question. For instance, the percentage point difference in acceptance
rates is the acceptance rate for men minus the acceptance rate for
women. A positive value indicates that men received the outcome more
often than women, whereas a negative value indicates that women
outperformed men in the given metric.

\textbf{Logistic regression models} For the L2-regularized logistic
regression models, we established modeling pipelines for a binary
prediction task. First, we randomly split the data into training and
test sets so that the training set consisted of 80\% of the full data
set while the test set was composed of the remaining 20\% of the data.
To maintain the distribution of the two model outcomes found with the
full data set, we performed stratified splits. The training data was
used to build the models and the test set was used for evaluating
predictive performance. To build the models, we performed an internal
five-fold cross-validation where we tuned the cost hyper-parameter,
which determines the regularization strength where smaller values
specify stronger regularization. This internal cross-validation was
repeated 100 times. Then, we trained the full training data set with the
selected hyper-parameter values and applied the model to the held-out
data to evaluate the testing predictive performance of each model. The
data-split, hyper-parameter selection, training and testing steps were
repeated 25 times to get a reliable and robust reading of model
performance. Models were trained using the machine learning wrapper
caret package (v.6.0.81) in R (v.3.5.0) (72).

\includegraphics{population_diagram.png} \textbf{Figure 1. Overview of
manuscript outcomes.} Over 100,000 manuscript records were obtained for
the period between January 2012 and August 2018. After eliminating
non-primary research manuscripts and linking records for resubmitted
manuscripts, we processed 81,897 unique manuscripts. The median number
of versions was 1 (iqr=0-2) with a median of 6 (iqr=1-11) authors per
manuscript. As of August 2018, 34,196 of these were published. Over
1,000 of the manuscripts were accepted without revisions at their first
submission and there were 4,337 women (orange), 10,152 men (blue), and
3,037 unknown gendered individuals associated with their records (e.g.,
author, editor, reviewer). Revisions were requested for 26,016
manuscripts and 54,389 manuscripts were rejected at their first
submission. *A small number were given revise (242) or acceptance (1094)
