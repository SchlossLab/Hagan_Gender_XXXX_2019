	abstract = {More than 50 studies of scientists in various fields show that women publish less than men. Moreover, correlations between gender and productivity have been roughly constant since the 1920s. The existence and stability of gender differences in productivity continue to be puzzling. Drawing upon data on publications by and citations to 263 matched pairs of men and women scientists (N = 526) who received doctorates in 1969-1 970, we examine productivity and impact over the first 12 years of scientists' careers to determine whether disparities observed in prior studies persist and, if so, to what degree and why. Aggregate gender differences in productivity in the cohort of 1970 are much like those in earlier ones. Women published slightly more than half (57\%) as many papers as men, with that proportion decreasing somewhat as time passed. However, women now account for 26\% of the most prolific scientists in the cohort (those who published at least 1.6 papers annually) as against just 8\% in the cohort of 1957-1958 in comparable years. Since highly productive scientists contribute disproportionately to the literature and presumably to the development of scientific knowledge, the increased representation of women in this group is significant.

The theme of gender equality is a key part of the sustainable development goals as set out by the United Nations.3 Goal 5 aims to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.” Sustainability is deeply embedded within Elsevier, and this report is part of a larger initiative on sustainability.4 Specifically, this report provides evidence and analysis on potential gender gaps in research in Germany. It combines data from Scopus®, the largest abstract and citation database in the world, with data from a large online social networking service. Linking these two sources of Big Data allows us to identify the gender of German researchers in Scopus® author profiles. The findings of the report contribute to the discussions on gender inequality in research and support the formulation of policies in the future to promote women in science.},

Drawing upon our high-quality global data sources, analytical expertise and unique gender disambiguation methodology, Elsevier has produced this comprehensive new report, Gender in the Global Research Landscape, as an evidence-based examination of research performance worldwide through a gender lens and as a vehicle for understanding the role of gender within the structure of the global research enterprise. This free report covers 20 years, 12 geographies and 27 subject areas, providing powerful insight and guidance on gender research and gender equality policy for governments, funders and institutions worldwide. In addition to global results and trends, Gender in the Global Research Landscape includes thought-provoking interviews with global experts. The report is based on Elsevier’s SciVal and Scopus data combined with name data from social media, applied onomastics, and Wikipedia. The analyses were further informed by input from stakeholder organizations and individuals around the world including the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). We partnered with expert stakeholder organizations and individuals around the world to advise on the report’s development, including the research questions, methodologies, and analytics, and to provide a policy context for the report findings. Gender in the Global Research Landscape is a follow-on to Elsevier's groundbreaking 2015 report, Mapping Gender in the German Research Arena.},

	abstract = {Little is known about how discrimination manifests before individuals formally apply to organizations or how it varies within and between organizations. We address this knowledge gap through an audit study in academia of over 6,500 professors at top U.S. universities drawn from 89 disciplines and 259 institutions. In our experiment, professors were contacted by fictional prospective students seeking to discuss research opportunities prior to applying to a doctoral program. Names of students were randomly assigned to signal gender and race (Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, Indian, Chinese), but messages were otherwise identical. We hypothesized that discrimination would appear at the informal “pathway” preceding entry to academia and would vary by discipline and university as a function of faculty representation and pay. We found that when considering requests from prospective students seeking mentoring in the future, faculty were significantly more responsive to Caucasian males than to all other categories of students, collectively, particularly in higher-paying disciplines and private institutions. Counterintuitively, the representation of women and minorities and discrimination were uncorrelated, a finding that suggests greater representation cannot be assumed to reduce discrimination. This research highlights the importance of studying decisions made before formal entry points into organizations and reveals that discrimination is not evenly distributed within and between organizations.},

	abstract = {Lower visibility of female scientists, compared to male scientists, is a potential reason for the under-representation of women among senior academic ranks. Visibility in the scientiﬁc community stems partly from presenting research as an invited speaker at organized meetings. We analysed the sex ratio of presenters at the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) Congress 2011, where all abstract submissions were accepted for presentation. Women were under-represented among invited speakers at symposia (15\% women) compared to all presenters (46\%), regular oral presenters (41\%) and plenary speakers (25\%). At the ESEB congresses in 2001–2011, 9–23\% of invited speakers were women. This under-representation of women is partly attributable to a larger proportion of women, than men, declining invitations: in 2011, 50\% of women declined an invitation to speak compared to 26\% of men. We expect invited speakers to be scientists from top ranked institutions or authors of recent papers in high-impact journals. Considering all invited speakers (including declined invitations), 23\% were women. This was lower than the baseline sex ratios of early-mid career stage scientists, but was similar to senior scientists and authors that have published in high-impact journals. High-quality science by women therefore has low exposure at international meetings, which will constrain Evolutionary Biology from reaching its full potential. We wish to highlight the wider implications of turning down invitations to speak, and encourage conference organizers to implement steps to increase acceptance rates of invited talks.},

This study focused on peer reviewer gender and examined differences in review behaviour by gender among 2,178 peer reviewers for two behavioural science journals over a period of 9 years. Analyses revealed that women were signiﬁcantly more likely to accept review invitations and took more time to complete reviews than men. We found no gender differences for the total number of invitations to review or for days to respond to invitations. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of concerns about obtaining peer review and for future research on peer review.},

Editorial board memberships are an important example of such positions; membership is both a professional honor in recognition of achievement and an opportunity for professional advancement. We surveyed 10 highly regarded journals in environmental biology, natural resource management, and plant sciences to quantify the number of women on their editorial boards and in positions of editorial leadership (i.e., Associate Editors and Editors-in-Chief) from 1985 to 2013. We found that during this time period only 16\% of subject editors were women, with more pronounced disparities in positions of editorial leadership. Although the trend was towards improvement over time, there was surprising variation between journals, including those with similar disciplinary foci. While demographic changes in academia may reduce these disparities over time, we argue journals should proactively strive for gender parity on their editorial boards. This will both increase the number of women afforded the opportunities and benefits that accompany board membership and increase the number of role models and potential mentors for early-career scientists and students.},

	abstract = {Background—Prior text analysis of R01 critiques suggested that female applicants may be disadvantaged in NIH peer review, particularly for R01 renewals. NIH altered its review format in 2009. The authors examined R01 critiques and scoring in the new format for differences due to principal investigator (PI) sex.
Method—The authors analyzed 739 critiques—268 from 88 unfunded and 471 from 153 funded applications for grants awarded to 125 PIs (M = 76, 61\% F = 49, 39\%) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison between 2010 and 2014. The authors used 7 word categories for text analysis: ability, achievement, agentic, negative evaluation, positive evaluation, research, and standout adjectives. The authors used regression models to compare priority and criteria scores, and results from text analysis for differences due to PI sex and whether the application was for a new (Type 1) or renewal (Type 2) R01.
Results—Approach scores predicted priority scores for all PIs’ applications (P{\textless}.001); but scores and critiques differed significantly for male and female PIs’ Type 2 applications. Reviewers assigned significantly worse priority, approach, and significance scores to female than male PIs’ Type 2 applications, despite using standout adjectives (e.g., “outstanding,” “excellent”) and making references to ability in more of their critiques (P{\textless}.05 for all comparisons).
Conclusions—The authors’ analyses suggest that subtle gender bias may continue to operate in the post-2009 NIH review format in ways that could lead reviewers to implicitly hold male and female applicants to different standards of evaluation, particularly for R01 renewals.},

	abstract = {Purpose—Despite sincere commitment to egalitarian, meritocratic principles, subtle gender bias persists, constraining women’s opportunities for academic advancement. The authors implemented a pair-matched, single-blind, cluster-randomized, controlled study of a gender bias habit-changing intervention at a large public university.
Method—Participants were faculty in 92 departments or divisions at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Between September 2010 and March 2012, experimental departments were offered a gender bias habit-changing intervention as a 2.5 hour workshop. Surveys measured gender bias awareness; motivation, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations to reduce bias; and gender equity action. A timed word categorization task measured implicit gender/leadership bias. Faculty completed a worklife survey before and after all experimental departments received the intervention. Control departments were offered workshops after data were collected.
Results—Linear mixed-effects models showed significantly greater changes post-intervention for faculty in experimental vs. control departments on several outcome measures, including selfefficacy to engage in gender equity promoting behaviors (P = .013). When ≥ 25\% of a department’s faculty attended the workshop (26 of 46 departments), significant increases in selfreported action to promote gender equity occurred at 3 months (P = .007). Post-intervention, faculty in experimental departments expressed greater perceptions of fit (P = .024), valuing of their research (P = .019), and comfort in raising personal and professional conflicts (P = .025).
Conclusions—An intervention that facilitates intentional behavioral change can help faculty break the gender bias habit and change department climate in ways that should support the career advancement of women in academic medicine, science, and engineering.},

	abstract = {We investigated the hypothesis that the gender of conveners at scientiﬁc meetings inﬂuenced the gender distribution of invited speakers. Analysis of 460 symposia involving 1,845 speakers in two large meetings sponsored by the American Society for Microbiology revealed that having at least one woman member of the convening team correlated with a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of invited female speakers and reduced the likelihood of an all-male symposium roster. Our results suggest that inclusion of more women as conveners may increase the proportion of women among invited speakers at scientiﬁc meetings. IMPORTANCE The proportion of women entering scientiﬁc careers has increased substantially, but women remain underrepresented in academic ranks. Participation in meetings as a speaker is a factor of great importance for academic advancement. We found that having a woman as a convener greatly increased women’s participation in symposia, suggesting that one mechanism for achieving gender balance at scientiﬁc meetings is to involve more women as conveners.},

Analysis of the data by career stage and gender revealed that misconduct occurred across the entire career spectrum from trainee to senior scientist and that two-thirds of the individuals found to have committed misconduct were male. This exceeds the overall proportion of males among life science trainees and faculty. These observations underscore the need for additional efforts to understand scientiﬁc misconduct and to ensure the responsible conduct of research. IMPORTANCE As many of humanity’s greatest problems require scientiﬁc solutions, it is critical for the scientiﬁc enterprise to function optimally. Misconduct threatens the scientiﬁc enterprise by undermining trust in the validity of scientiﬁc ﬁndings. We have examined speciﬁc demographic characteristics of individuals found to have committed research misconduct in the life sciences. Our ﬁnding that misconduct occurs across all stages of career development suggests that attention to ethical aspects of the conduct of science should not be limited to those in training. The observation that males are overrepresented among those who commit misconduct implies a gender difference that needs to be better understood in any effort to promote research integrity.},

	abstract = {Background: Women are less successful than men in renewing R01 grants from the National Institutes of Health. Continuing to probe text mining as a tool to identify gender bias in peer review, we used algorithmic text mining and qualitative analysis to examine a sample of critiques from men’s and women’s R01 renewal applications previously analyzed by counting and comparing word categories.
Methods: We analyzed 241 critiques from 79 Summary Statements for 51 R01 renewals awarded to 45 investigators (64\% male, 89\% white, 80\% PhD) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison between 2010 and 2014. We used latent Dirichlet allocation to discover evaluative ‘‘topics’’ (i.e., words that co-occur with high probability). We then qualitatively examined the context in which evaluative words occurred for male and female investigators. We also examined sex differences in assigned scores controlling for investigator productivity.
Results: Text analysis results showed that male investigators were described as ‘‘leaders’’ and ‘‘pioneers’’ in their ‘‘ﬁelds,’’ with ‘‘highly innovative’’ and ‘‘highly signiﬁcant research.’’ By comparison, female investigators were characterized as having ‘‘expertise’’ and working in ‘‘excellent’’ environments. Applications from men received signiﬁcantly better priority, approach, and signiﬁcance scores, which could not be accounted for by differences in productivity.
Conclusions: Results conﬁrm our previous analyses suggesting that gender stereotypes operate in R01 grant peer review. Reviewers may more easily view male than female investigators as scientiﬁc leaders with signiﬁcant and innovative research, and score their applications more competitively. Such implicit bias may contribute to sex differences in award rates for R01 renewals.},

	abstract = {Background: Reports indicate that there are gender-based differences in aspects of the peer-review process.
Methods: This is an analysis of editorial board members’ reviews of original research submissions based on gender using the web-based management program, Editorial Manager, from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2008. We evaluated recommendations of editorial board members for acceptance=rejection using a four-tier system, agreement with editor’s ﬁnal decision, turnaround time from review request to submission, and editors’ grades of reviews on a 5-point scale. We evaluated the performance of editorial board members with advancing tenure, seeking trends in recommendations over time.
Results: We included 6062 manuscript reviews representing 5958 manuscripts; 67\% were assigned to male editorial board members and 33\% to females. There were 38 editorial board members (25 men, 13 women) with tenure duration from 2 to 4.9 years, and 3 editors (2 men, 1 woman) serving 7, 7, and 6 years, respectively. Women were less likely to accept or accept with minor revisions than men ( p {\textless} 0.003). Median turnaround times were 14 (0–55) days for women and 10 (0–33) days for men ( p {\textless} 0.001). The editors’ grades assigned to women were more often than men’s grades in the very good to exceptional category ( p {\textless} 0.0001). There was no difference based on gender, with approximately 73\% decision congruence overall with the editors’ ﬁnal decisions. Men rejected more manuscripts than did women with advancing tenure on the editorial board ( p {\textless} 0.0001).
Conclusions: There are differences based on gender of editorial board members’ recommendations about manuscript triage, turnaround time, and editors’ grades assigned. Overall, however, these differences do not affect editors’ ultimate decisions about manuscript publication.},

Design and Setting.—Cross-sectional study of 4 US epidemiology journals, American Journal of Epidemiology, Annals of Epidemiology, Epidemiology, and the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology (formerly the Journal of Chronic Diseases), for 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1994. Subjects.—Editors, authors, and reviewers for the selected years. Main Outcome Measures.—Sex of editors, authors, and reviewers.
Results.—We identiﬁed 2415 reports associated with 8005 authors. One of 7 editors in chief was a woman, a position she shared with a man. For all journals, the proportion of editors who were women ranged from 5 (6.5\%) of 77 in 1982 to 42 (16.3\%) of 258 in 1994. Over all journals and all years, women comprised a higher proportion of authors (28.7\% [2225/7743] ) compared with reviewers (26.7\% [796/2982]) or editors (12.8\% [89/696]).
Conclusions.—Fewer women in public health hold editorial positions than are authors and reviewers. The reasons for this important discrepancy, including the possibility of a selection bias favoring men, should be further investigated.},

	abstract = {Gender disparities appear to be decreasing in academia according to a number of metrics, such as grant funding, hiring, acceptance at scholarly journals, and productivity, and it might be tempting to think that gender inequity will soon be a problem of the past. However, a large-scale analysis based on over eight million papers across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities reveals a number of understated and persistent ways in which gender inequities remain. For instance, even where raw publication counts seem to be equal between genders, close inspection reveals that, in certain fields, men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions. Moreover, women are significantly underrepresented as authors of single-authored papers. Academics should be aware of the subtle ways that gender disparities can occur in scholarly authorship.},

In 2006, we conducted an online survey of 1334 ecologists and evolutionary biologists pertaining to the review process. Respondents were from Europe, North America and other regions of the world, with the majority from English first language countries. Women comprised a third of all respondents, consistent with their representation in the scientific academic community. Among respondents we found no correlation between the time typically taken over a review and the reported average rejection rate. On average, Europeans took longer over reviewing a manuscript than North Americans, and females took longer than males, but reviewed fewer manuscripts. Males recommended rejection of manuscripts more frequently than females, regardless of region. Hence, editors and potential authors should consider alternative sets of criteria, to what exists now, when selecting a panel of referees to potentially balance different tendencies by gender or region.},

	abstract = {Women’s representation in science has changed substantially, but unevenly, over the past 40 years. In health and biological sciences, for example, women’s representation among U.S. scientists is now on par with or greater than men’s, while in physical sciences and engineering they remain a clear minority. We investigated whether variation in proportions of women in scientiﬁc disciplines is related to differing levels of male-favoring explicit or implicit stereotypes held by students and scientists in each discipline. We hypothesized that science-is-male stereotypes would be weaker in disciplines where women are better represented. This prediction was tested with a sample of 176,935 college-educated participants (70\% female), including thousands of engineers, physicians, and scientists. The prediction was supported for the explicit stereotype, but not for the implicit stereotype. Implicit stereotype strength did not correspond with disciplines’ gender ratios, but, rather, correlated with two indicators of disciplines’ scientiﬁc intensity, positively for men and negatively for women. From age 18 on, women who majored or worked in disciplines perceived as more scientiﬁc had substantially weaker science-is-male stereotypes than did men in the same disciplines, with gender differences larger than 0.8 standard deviations in the most scientiﬁcally-perceived disciplines. Further, particularly for women, differences in the strength of implicit stereotypes across scientiﬁc disciplines corresponded with the strength of scientiﬁc values held by women in the disciplines. These results are discussed in the context of dual process theory of mental operation and balanced identity theory. The ﬁndings point to the need for longitudinal study of the factors’ affecting development of adults’ and, especially, children’s implicit gender stereotypes and scientiﬁc identity.},

	abstract = {Women generally, and women of color speciﬁcally, have reported hostile workplace experiences in astronomy and related ﬁelds for some time. However, little is known of the extent to which individuals in these disciplines experience inappropriate remarks, harassment, and assault. We hypothesized that the multiple marginality of women of color would mean that they would experience a higher frequency of inappropriate remarks, harassment, and assault in the astronomical and planetary science workplace. We conducted an internet-based survey of the workplace experiences of 474 astronomers and planetary scientists between 2011 and 2015 and found support for this hypothesis. In this sample, in nearly every signiﬁcant ﬁnding, women of color experienced the highest rates of negative workplace experiences, including harassment and assault. Further, 40\% of women of color reported feeling unsafe in the workplace as a result of their gender or sex, and 28\% of women of color reported feeling unsafe as a result of their race. Finally, 18\% of women of color, and 12\% of white women, skipped professional events because they did not feel safe attending, identifying a signiﬁcant loss of career opportunities due to a hostile climate. Our results suggest that the astronomy and planetary science community needs to address the experiences of women of color and white women as they move forward in their efforts to create an inclusive workplace for all scientists.

In this sample, in nearly every signiﬁcant ﬁnding, women of color experienced the highest rates of negative workplace experiences, including harassment and assault. Further, women of color reported feeling unsafe in the workplace as a result of their gender or sex 40\% of the time, and as a result of their race 28\% of the time. Finally, 18\% of women of color, and 12\% of white women, skipped professional events because they did not feel safe attending, identifying a signiﬁcant loss of career opportunities due to a hostile climate. Our results suggest that certain community members may be at additional risk of hostile workplace experiences due to their gender, race, or both.},

Biology is the most gender equitable of all scientific fields by the marker of degree attainment, with 52.5\% of PhDs awarded to women. However, equitable rates of degree completion do not translate into equitable attainment of faculty or postdoctoral positions, suggesting continued existence of gender inequalities. In a national cohort of 336 first-year PhD students in the biological sciences (i.e., microbiology, cellular biology, molecular biology, developmental biology, and genetics) from 53 research institutions, female participants logged significantly more research hours than males and were significantly more likely than males to attribute their work hours to the demands of their assigned projects over the course of the academic year. Despite this, males were 15\% more likely to be listed as authors on published journal articles, indicating inequality in the ratio of time to credit. Given the cumulative advantage that accrues for students who publish early in their graduate careers and the central role that scholarly productivity plays in academic hiring decisions, these findings collectively point to a major potential source of persisting underrepresentation of women on university faculties in these fields.},

However, there are relatively few evaluations of diversity interventions designed to reduce gender biases within the STEM community. Because gender biases distort the meritocratic evaluation and advancement of students, interventions targeting instructors’ biases are particularly needed. We evaluated one such intervention, a workshop called “Scientific Diversity” that was consistent with an established framework guiding the development of diversity interventions designed to reduce biases and was administered to a sample of life science instructors (N = 126) at several sessions of the National Academies Summer Institute for Undergraduate Education held nationwide. Evidence emerged indicating the efficacy of the “Scientific Diversity” workshop, such that participants were more aware of gender bias, expressed less gender bias, and were more willing to engage in actions to reduce gender bias 2 weeks after participating in the intervention compared with 2 weeks before the intervention. Implications for diversity interventions aimed at reducing gender bias and broadening the participation of women in the life sciences are discussed.},

We investigated the effects of gender, nationality (English-speaking countries only), academic age, year of review, and handling editor on the decisions made on a sample of 1856 papers submitted to the journal Biological Conservation between 2004 and 2007. There is no evidence of differences in acceptance rates among genders, nationalities, academic age, or year, nor is there evidence for interactions among these factors. Individual handling editors differed in the proportions of papers that they accepted, rejected following review, and rejected without review, but did not show biases based on any of the factors we examined. Overall, we did not ﬁnd evidence supporting a change in the present review system, although the low rate of acceptance of papers from certain non-English-speaking countries is an issue that needs to be addressed. We believe that these types of audits of the editorial system are necessary, so that all submitting authors feel that the editorial process is fair, unbiased and rigorous.},

On average, women were underrepresented as speakers, though this effect diminished over time. Chairs appeared to serve as gatekeepers: In symposia chaired by women, almost half of the invited speakers were women, whereas in symposia chaired by men, it was a third. The representation of women as speakers varied significantly by academic rank, with women underrepresented at lower ranks but not as full professors, and by topic. Women also tended to present with a smaller, less varied array of individuals than men, though this could be explained by women’s lower average academic rank.},

Study 2 tested whether the male-dominated status of a field triggers such effort expectations.We created a fictional “eco-psychology” graduate program, which when depicted as male-dominated resulted in women expecting to exert relatively more effort and decreased their interest in pursuing the field. Study 3 found emphasizing effort as expected (and normal) to achieve success elevated women’s feelings of belonging and future motivation. Results suggest effort expenditure perceptions are an indicator women use to assess their fit in STEM. Implications for enhancing women’s participation in STEM are discussed.},

	abstract = {Past research has demonstrated an under-representation of female editors and reviewers in top scientific journals, but very few studies have examined the representation of women authors within original research articles. We collected research article publication records from 15 highprofile multidisciplinary and neuroscience journals for 2005-2017 and analyzed the representation of women over time, as well as its relationship with journal impact factor. We found that 1) Women authors have been persistently underrepresented in high-profile journals. This under-representation has persisted over more than a decade, with glacial improvement over time. 2) The percent of female first and last authors is negatively associated with a journal’s impact factor. Since publishing in high-profile journals is a gateway to academic success, this underrepresentation of women may contribute to the lack of women at the top of the scientific academic ladder.},

	abstract = {Background: Funding agencies around the world show gender gaps in grant success, with women often receiving less funding than men. However, these studies have been observational and some have not accounted for potential confounding variables, making it difficult to draw robust conclusions about whether gaps were due to bias or to other factors. In 2014, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) phased out traditional investigator-initiated programs and created a natural experiment by dividing all investigator-initiated funding into two new grant programs: one with and one without an explicit review focus on the caliber of the principal investigator. In this study, we aimed to determine whether these differently-structured grant programs had different success rates among male and female applicants.
Methods: We analyzed results of 23,918 grant applications from 7,093 unique applicants in a 5year natural experiment across all open, investigator-initiated CIHR grant programs in 20112016. Our primary outcome was grant application success. We used Generalized Estimating Equations to account for multiple applications by the same applicant and an interaction term between each principal investigator’s self-reported sex and grant program group to compare any gaps in success rates among male and female applicants in the two new programs to the baseline gap in traditional programs. Because younger cohorts of investigators and fields such as health services research and population health have higher proportions of women, our analysis controlled for principal investigators’ ages and applications’ research domains.
Results: The overall grant success rate across all competitions was 15.8\%. After adjusting for age and research domain, the predicted probability of funding success among male principal investigators’ applications in traditional programs was 0.9 percentage points higher than it was among female principal investigators’ applications (OR 0.934, 95\% CI 0.854-1.022). In the new program in which review focused on the quality of the proposed science, the gap was 0.9\% in favour of male principal investigators and not significantly different from traditional programs (OR 0.998, 95\% CI 0.794-1.229). In the new program with an explicit review focus on the caliber of the principal investigator, the gap was 4.0\% in favour of male principal investigators, significantly larger than in traditional programs (OR 0.705, 95\% CI 0.519-0.960).
Conclusions: Avoiding bias in grant review is necessary to ensure the best research is funded, regardless of who proposes it. In this study, gender gaps in grant success rates were significantly larger when there was an explicit review focus on the principal investigator. Because of the quasi-experimental study design, these findings offer more conclusive evidence},

	title = {Is there gender bias in reviewer selection and publication success rates for the},
	volume = {38},
	abstract = {Gender bias in the sciences is a prominent issue. Evidence suggests that more equal involvement of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields leads to a diversity of working styles that can contribute to multiple measures of workplace success, such as better student outcomes in university settings and improved managerial approaches. One of the main ways we can combat gender bias is by increasing awareness. Thus, to directly draw attention to this issue for New Zealand ecologists, we performed a gender analysis of the publication process in the New Zealand Journal of Ecology (NZJE) for manuscripts reviewed between 2003 and 2012. First, we compared the frequencies of publication success between female and male authors. Second, we compared the frequencies of female and male reviewers selected by both female and male associate editors on the journal’s editorial board from 2010 to 2012. Results show that publication success was not biased by gender, nor was it related to the gender of the editor. However, editors selected more male reviewers and this pattern was slightly more pronounced for male editors, suggesting that there is potential for at least some associate editors to reduce gender bias in their reviewer selections. We believe this will become easier with the development of the new reviewer database and mentoring scheme recently launched by the NZJE. It is important that publication of ecological research in New Zealand is unbiased so that the growing numbers of women in this field are not disadvantaged, and our results show that the NZJE is doing a good job at this. However, it is also important that women’s contributions to the field are encouraged and recognised. We believe that reviewer selection is one way to enhance this and we strongly encourage early-career female ecologists to enrol in the NZJE mentoring scheme.},

	abstract = {We present a study on the gender balance, in speakers and attendees, at the recent major astronomical conference, the American Astronomical Society meeting 223, in Washington, DC. We conducted an informal survey, yielding over 300 responses by volunteers at the meeting. Each response included gender data about a single talk given at the meeting, recording the gender of the speaker and all question-askers. In total, 225 individual AAS talks were sampled. We analyze basic statistical properties of this sample. We ﬁnd that the gender ratio of the speakers closely matched the gender ratio of the conference attendees. The audience asked an average of 2.8 questions per talk. Talks given by women had a slightly higher number of questions asked (3.2±0.2) than talks given by men (2.6±0.1). The most signiﬁcant result from this study is that while the gender ratio of speakers very closely mirrors that of conference attendees, women are under-represented in the question-asker category. We interpret this to be an age-eﬀect, as senior scientists may be more likely to ask questions, and are more commonly men. A strong dependence on the gender of session chairs is found, whereby women ask disproportionately fewer questions in sessions chaired by men. While our results point to laudable progress in gender-balanced speaker selection, we believe future surveys of this kind would help ensure that collaboration at such meetings is as inclusive as possible.},

However, medicine successfully recruits and retains women physicians, despite being less family friendly than biology in terms of workload, stress, and inflexible work hours. Both professions are competitive but at different times in a person’s career. Competition for entry into medical school is intense, but this period of competition occurs prior to family formation for most women. For women biologists, the most intense period of competition occurs during the search for faculty positions. Many women have partners or children at this time. The increasing competition for academic positions threatens to reverse the gains that women have made into the professoriate in biology, as well as in other sciences.},

	abstract = {Similarity breeds connection. This principle-the homophily principle-structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: ( a ) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

	abstract = {Although the number of U.S. female professors has risen steadily in recent years, female professors are still subject to different student expectations and treatment. Students continue to perceive and expect female professors to be more nurturing than male professors are. We examined whether students may consequently request more special favors from female professors. In a survey of professors (n = 88) across the United States, Study 1 found that female (versus male) professors reported getting more requests for standard work demands, special favors, and friendship behaviors, with the latter two mediating the professor gender effect on professors’ self-reported emotional labor. Study 2 utilized an experimental design using a fictitious female or male professor, with college student participants (n = 121) responding to a scenario in which a special favor request might be made of the professor. The results indicated that academically entitled students (i.e., those who feel deserving of success in college regardless of effort/ performance) had stronger expectations that a female (versus male) professor would grant their special favor requests. Those expectations consequently increased students’ likelihood of making the requests and of exhibiting negative emotional and behavioral reactions to having those requests denied. This work highlights the extra burdens felt by female professors. We discuss possible moderators of these effects as well as the importance of developing strategies for preventing them.},

We ﬁnd evidence in both data sources that, on average, women faculty perform signiﬁcantly more service than men, controlling for rank, race/ethnicity, and ﬁeld or department. Our analyses suggest that the male–female differential is driven more by internal service—i.e., service to the university, campus, or department—than external service—i.e., service to the local, national, and international communities—although signiﬁcant heterogeneity exists across ﬁeld and discipline in the way gender differentials play out.},

	abstract = {Background: Although there has been a continuous increase in the number of women working in the ﬁeld of medicine, women rarely reach the highest academic positions as full professors or editorial board members.
Objective: We aimed to determine the proportion of women on the editorial boards of top-ranked medical journals in different medical specialties.
Methods: We analyzed the gender of editorial board members of 60 top-ranked journals of 12 Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge Journal Citation Reports categories. A total of 4175 editors were included in our analysis.
Results: Only 15.9\% (10 of 63) editors-in-chief were female. In the 5 categories, critical care, anesthesiology, orthopedics, ophthalmology and radiology, nuclear medicine and medical imaging, currently not 1 woman holds the position of editor-in-chief. Less than one ﬁfth (17.5\%, 719 of 4112) of all editorial board members were women. There were signiﬁcant differences among the evaluated categories, with the highest percentage of women in the category of medicine, general and internal and the lowest in the category critical care, followed by orthopedics. In every category, the proportion of women as editorial board members was substantially lower than that of men.
Conclusions: Women are underrepresented on the editorial boards of major medical journals, although there is a great variability among the journals and categories analyzed. If more women are nominated to serve on editorial boards, they will be a visible sign of continuing progress and serve as important role models for young women contemplating a career in academic medicine.

Based on career and publication data of virtually all sociologists working in German sociology departments, we test how meritocratic factors (academic productivity) as well as non-meritocratic factors (ascription, symbolic and social capital) inﬂuence the chances of getting a permanent professorship in sociology. Our ﬁndings show that getting tenure in sociology is strongly related to scholarly output, as previous studies have shown. Improving on existing studies, however, we show speciﬁcally that each refereed journal article and each monograph increases a sociologist’s chance for tenure by 10 to 15 percent, while other publications affect odds for tenure only marginally and in some cases even negatively. Regarding non-meritocratic factors, we show that network size, individual reputation, and gender matters. Women get their ﬁrst permanent position as university professor with on average 23 to 44 percent fewer publications than men; all else being equal, they are about 1.4 times more likely to get tenure than men. The article generally contributes to a better understanding of the role of meritocratic and non-meritocratic factors in achieving scarce and highly competitive job positions in academia.},

In this study we sought to verify the hypothesis that researcher's gender affects evaluation of his or her work, especially in a ﬁeld where women only represent a minority. Towards this end we asked a sample of subjects, mostly economics majors, to evaluate a paper written by mixed-gender couples, indicating that it was (co-)authored by a “female economist”, “male economist”, “young female economist” or “young male economist” or giving no information about the author at all. While age factor played no role, female authors appeared to be seen as less competent than males, in that subjects (being incentivized to give their best judgment) less often believed that their papers have been published. This effect did not interact strongly with the gender of the subject.},

Gender differences in interest in computer science, engineering, and physics appear even before college. Why are women represented in some science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields more than others? We conduct a critical review of the most commonly cited factors explaining gender disparities in STEM participation and investigate whether these factors explain differential gender participation across STEM fields. Math performance and discrimination influence who enters STEM, but there is little evidence to date that these factors explain why women’s underrepresentation is relatively worse in some STEM fields. We introduce a model with three overarching factors to explain the larger gender gaps in participation in computer science, engineering, and physics than in biology, chemistry, and mathematics: (a) masculine cultures that signal a lower sense of belonging to women than men, (b) a lack of sufficient early experience with these fields, and (c) gender gaps in self-efficacy. Efforts to increase women’s participation in computer science, engineering, and physics may benefit from changing their masculine cultures and providing students with early experiences that signal to both girls and boys that they belong and can succeed in these fields.},

Data from faculty surveyed in nine US research universities point to ways that formal and informal organizational indicators predict the clarity of evaluation reported by women and men. Unexpected patterns occur by gender. Among men, both formal and informal organizational indicators, as well as field, predict their reported clarity of evaluation. Among women, however, only informal organizational indicators, namely, frequency of speaking with faculty about research and departmental climate, are significant predictors. Further, overall, informal indicators are stronger predictors of clarity than are formal indicators, and some field differences occur. These findings have implications for national and regional science policies and for the practices and policies of universities.},

	abstract = {Women’s underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) ﬁelds is a prominent concern in our society and many others. Closer inspection of this phenomenon reveals a more nuanced picture, however, with women achieving parity with men at the Ph.D. level in certain STEM ﬁelds, while also being underrepresented in some non-STEM ﬁelds. It is important to consider and provide an account of this ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld variability. The ﬁeld-speciﬁc ability beliefs (FAB) hypothesis aims to provide such an account, proposing that women are likely to be underrepresented in ﬁelds thought to require raw intellectual talent—a sort of talent that women are stereotyped to possess less of than men. In two studies, we provide evidence for the FAB hypothesis, demonstrating that the academic ﬁelds believed by laypeople to require brilliance are also the ﬁelds with lower female representation. We also found that the FABs of participants with college-level exposure to a ﬁeld were more predictive of its female representation than those of participants without college exposure, presumably because the former beliefs mirror more closely those of the ﬁeld’s practitioners (the direct “gatekeepers”). Moreover, the FABs of participants with college exposure to a ﬁeld predicted the magnitude of the ﬁeld’s gender gap above and beyond their beliefs about the level of mathematical and verbal skills required. Finally, we found that beliefs about the importance of brilliance to success in a ﬁeld may predict its female representation in part by fostering the impression that the ﬁeld demands solitary work and competition with others. These results suggest new solutions for enhancing diversity within STEM and across the academic spectrum.},

	abstract = {Women comprise a minority of the Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) workforce. Quantifying the gender gap may identify fields that will not reach parity without intervention, reveal underappreciated biases, and inform benchmarks for gender balance among conference speakers, editors, and hiring committees. Using the PubMed and arXiv databases, we estimated the gender of 36 million authors from {\textgreater}100 countries publishing in {\textgreater}6000 journals, covering most STEMM disciplines over the last 15 years, and made a web app allowing easy access to the data (https://lukeholman.github.io/ genderGap/). Despite recent progress, the gender gap appears likely to persist for generations, particularly in surgery, computer science, physics, and maths. The gap is especially large in authorship positions associated with seniority, and prestigious journals have fewer women authors. Additionally, we estimate that men are invited by journals to submit papers at approximately double the rate of women. Wealthy countries, notably Japan, Germany, and Switzerland, had fewer women authors than poorer ones. We conclude that the STEMM gender gap will not close without further reforms in education, mentoring, and academic publishing.},

	abstract = {Women who start college in one of the natural or physical sciences leave in greater proportions than their male peers. The reasons for this difference are complex, and one possible contributing factor is the social environment women experience in the classroom. Using social network analysis, we explore how gender influences the confidence that collegelevel biology students have in each other’s mastery of biology. Results reveal that males are more likely than females to be named by peers as being knowledgeable about the course content. This effect increases as the term progresses, and persists even after controlling for class performance and outspokenness. The bias in nominations is specifically due to males over-nominating their male peers relative to their performance. The over-nomination of male peers is commensurate with an overestimation of male grades by 0.57 points on a 4 point grade scale, indicating a strong male bias among males when assessing their classmates. Females, in contrast, nominated equitably based on student performance rather than gender, suggesting they lacked gender biases in filling out these surveys. These trends persist across eleven surveys taken in three different iterations of the same Biology course. In every class, the most renowned students are always male. This favoring of males by peers could influence student self-confidence, and thus persistence in this STEM discipline.},

	abstract = {Background: While in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia, higher education and research institutions are widely engaged with the Athena SWAN Charter for Women in Science to advance gender equality, empirical research on this process and its impact is rare. This study combined two data sets (free- text comments from a survey and qualitative interviews) to explore the range of experiences and perceptions of participation in Athena SWAN in medical science departments of a research-intensive university in Oxford, United Kingdom.
Methods: The study is based on the secondary analysis of data from two projects: 59 respondents to an anonymous online survey (42 women, 17 men) provided relevant free-text comments and, separately, 37 women participated in face-to-face narrative interviews. Free-text survey comments and narrative interviews were analysed thematically using constant comparison.
Results: Both women and men said that participation in Athena SWAN had brought about important structural and cultural changes, including increased support for women’s careers, greater appreciation of caring responsibilities, and efforts to challenge discrimination and bias. Many said that these positive changes would not have happened without linkage of Athena SWAN to government research funding, while others thought there were unintended consequences. Concerns about the programme design and implementation included a perception that Athena SWAN has limited ability to address longstanding and entrenched power and pay imbalances, persisting lack of work-life balance in academic medicine, questions about the sustainability of positive changes, belief that achieving the award could become an end in itself, resentment about perceived positive discrimination, and perceptions that further structural and cultural changes were needed in the university and wider society.
Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that Athena SWAN has a positive impact in advancing gender equality, but there may be limits to how much it can improve gender equality without wider institutional and societal changes. To address the fundamental causes of gender inequality would require cultural change and welfare state policies incentivising men to increase their participation in unpaid work in the family, which is beyond the scope of higher education and research policy.},
